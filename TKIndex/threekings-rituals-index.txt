Please don't actually try this.

Hey r/nosleep, long time no see.

I've been posting bits and pieces of my life here, but I find them a little boring and self-serving (the last one about the juvie incidents was already like 70% made-up, to my shame) so today I'll post a recipe instead. This is not creepypasta (at least not yet) and I'm writing it from a train in the NYC area.

What I'm about to share with you today is one of the many relatively safe ways in which you can access (not quite enter) a place I call the "Shadowside", and its effectiveness depends on how seriously you take me; your mileage may vary, refer to title.

I won't tell you that you shouldn't be afraid of the Shadowside; chances are you've already seen it after all, and merely think it was just a "recurring dream". I will tell you there is no need to be ignorantly afraid of it, though. There is a difference. Ignorance fuels fear and fear can give that place a lot of juice to run on. You have to be big on preparation if you want to try this. It's like sky diving: if getting it right on your first try is not something you're good at, then this is not for you.

If you do drugs or alcohol the night of the event, you're going to have a bad time. If you're going through some serious issues in your life and are not feeling mentally or spiritually stable, or if you're doing this just to escape, you're going to have a bad time. And if you don't follow my instructions (particularly the multiple backups I'll give you, which trust me, are there for a reason) you're going to really have a bad time.

The name of this game is THE THREE KINGS, btw.

Ingredients:

    A very large empty and quiet room, preferably without windows. If windows exist, you need to be able to cover them and ensure total darkness. Basements usually work well, if they're roomy enough.

    A pack of candles (you'll only use 1, if all goes well), and a lighter.

    A bucket of water and a mug.

    A fan.

    Two large mirrors (like the one on your dresser. Don't worry, they won't be harmed. Or if they are, it'd be the least of your concerns).

    Three chairs.

    An alarm clock.

    An active cell phone (don't forget to charge the goddamn battery!)

    A loved one willing to follow rules and go along with all this madness.

    A small toy or dear object from your childhood.

Setup:

    Start setup at around 11 PM. Place one chair in the center of the room, facing north (this is important). Place the other two chairs exactly to the left and right, facing your throne. The distance between your throne and that of your queen and fool should be about the length of your arm to each side, more or less.

    Place the two large mirrors on the queen and fool chairs left and right of you, facing you (and each other). Try your best to have them stand at a 90 degree angle (or else you may get more or less than three kings). If you sit on your throne facing straight ahead (north), you should be able to perceive your own reflection in each of the two mirrors without actually having to turn your head nor your eyes to do so. If you see your own reflection in the corner of your eye, just barely there, then you've done it right.

    Place the bucket of water and the mug in front of you, just barely out of reach.

    Place the fan behind you, turn it on. Don't set it to maximum power -medium or low is usually enough. Leave it on.

    Turn off the lights, leave the door open and go to your bedroom.

    Set the candles by the side of the bed, next to a lighter, your alarm clock and your cellphone (leave it charging).

    Set your alarm clock for 3:30 AM.

    Turn off the lights and sleep while holding your power object, get some rest.

Showtime:

    Wake up at 3:30 AM with your alarm clock. Turn it off, but don't turn on the light. You have exactly three minutes to light your candle, grab your cellphone, and make your way to the dark room to sit in your throne. You should be seated by 3:33 AM. Don't forget your power object! Check for potential red flags: if your cellphone didn't charge for whatever reason, abort the mission. If the alarm didn't go off exactly at 3:30 AM, abort the mission. If you find the dark room door closed (remember you left it open) abort the mission. If the fan is turned off (you left it on) abort the mission.

    (Side note: if you have to abort the mission due to any of the above, leave the house with your loved one. Go to a hotel or something. There's no need to run; you have time to grab a jacket and your keys and what not, but leave. After 6 AM the coast should be clear.)

    If all is going as planned, you can proceed and take your throne. DO NOT look directly at either of the two mirrors besides you. DO NOT let the candle go out. The fan is behind you. You must protect the candle with your body, which is standing in between (there's a reason for this; as you'll soon see).

    Look straight ahead, at the darkness. Not at the candle, not at the mirrors, just straight ahead. Eagle-eyed readers surely noticed I didn't say during setup which chair was queen and which chair was fool. That's because it's your job to find out. And from their point of view, you are either their queen or their fool, too. Hence three kings.

I won't spoil what happens next. Suffice to say, you won't be alone and if you have questions, you'll get answers. Sometimes in the form of new questions, but hey, that's the story of humanity eh? Just stay put and try not to move. Again, DO NOT look directly at the mirrors, nor the candle. Just straight ahead, trust me. Don't chicken out either; you need to wait until 4:34. By 4:34 it's all over. It's okay to tremble a little bit, just try not to. Not because it affects the ritual or anything -it's just a pussy thing to do while in polite company.

Did I mention not to let the candle go out? That's what the fan is for. You're protecting the candle with your body, but if your body were to be suddenly moved then the fan would turn off the candle. That's backup number 1. Your loved one is backup number 2: at 4:34 she has to come in the room and call your name. If that won't work, she has to call your cellphone. If that won't work, she has the glass of water and the bucket. She can't touch you though -that's a newbie mistake. Backup number 3 is your item of power, the toy, or locket or whatever object of strength you brought along for the ride. It'll show you the way if SHTF.

Multiple back ups. You gotta be like a boy scout if you do these things. If you half-ass it, half-ass it all the way so that it won't work. Worst you can do is take it seriously enough for it to work and not seriously enough to be prepared for the consequences.

If in doubt, refer to title.

EDIT: By my count, 22 out of the 25 spots of nosleep's front page are taken by three kings posts at the moment. I love nosleep, and I do not wish to monopolize it this way. Per request, I've made a subreddit, and you're all invited. We need a moderator and we need to figure out what we want out of it. Please help us build it: r/threekings

Well, my good friend. I have some backstories of my own. And those are quite common Failsafes, although I don't understand, why it would be good to let the candle go off. Can you explain this OP? The other ones seem to make a lot of sense. Now, I'm not going to be the Guinea Pig, this is a very bad suggestion and you can bring people in a lot of trouble for it. I think you don't believe in this kind of things, but you either have to believe and be careful or treat it as a complete bullshit you don't want to spend your time with. If you do it half-assed, it will only bring bad energy. Now, as I assume you don't believe this shit but still want to find out, if it will go wrong. So, how about bringing you some firsthand-experiences? What about a visit, today, this night? If it scares you too much, turn on your light, you should be ok by then. You will notice the arrival by small cracking sounds and that your room-temperature will suddenly be a little lower. Don't try to fight it and don't believe anything you hear or see. Tell me tomorrow about it. It's a souvenir I got from a previous experience...

I found some science! Is this appreciated here? This is called The strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion
It doesn't really explain what's going on other than theorizing what your brain is doing though, which leaves it open to a lot of weirdness.

Here's what the subjects reported in a similar, but very simple, setup for a fraction of the time in the instructions by OP:

    At the end of a 10 min session of mirror gazing, the participant was asked to write what he or she saw in the mirror. The descriptions differed greatly across individuals and included:
    (a) huge deformations of one’s own face (reported by 66% of the fifty participants);
    (b) a parent’s face with traits changed (18%), of whom 8% were still alive and 10% were deceased;
    (c) an unknown person (28%);
    (d) an archetypal face, such as that of an old woman, a child, or a portrait of an ancestor (28%);
    (e) an animal face such as that of a cat, pig, or lion (18%);
    (f ) fantastical and monstrous beings (48%).

    The participants reported that apparition of new faces in the mirror caused sensations of otherness when the new face appeared to be that of another, unknown person or strange "other" looking at him/her from within or beyond the mirror. All fifty participants experienced some form of this dissociative identity effect, at least for some apparition of strange faces and often reported strong emotional responses in these instances. For example, some observers felt that the "other" watched them with an enigmatic expression – situation that they found astonishing.

    Some participants saw a malign expression on the "other" face and became anxious. Other participants felt that the "other" was smiling or cheerful, and experienced positive emotions in response. The apparition of deceased parents or of archetypal portraits produced feelings of silent query. Apparition of monstrous beings produced fear or disturbance. Dynamic deformations of new faces (like pulsations or shrinking, smiling or grinding) produced an overall sense of inquietude for things out of control.

Basing the comment on the assumption the ritual works like the other similar ones - someone, typically a dead person you once knew will enter from the shadows. She or he or it is open to questions and typically non hostile. The entrance is not frightening but quite peaceful, like seeing someone in the horizon slowly approaching you (or emerging from the darkness).

I've been told the scientific explanation to be that the candle and the empty darkness stimulates your imagination and you enter a trance like state. Similar to sleep. Having experienced lots of lucid dreams, I have to say it's nothing like dreaming.

9y

HOLY SHIT I understand now. When you look at a mirror in a lucid dream (I'm told) it triggers something mentally and becomes a nightmare, thus you should not look left or right. This is actually very cleverly fabricated if it works, it initiates the lucid hallucination and adds the possibility of a gut-wrenchingly terrifying experience should you actually look at one of the mirrors. So it would have the expected effect either way.

Bravo OP, bravo.

To all of you who are going to try this, do be careful. The things you will be conversing with do not have your best interests at heart. Be sure to be on your best behavior as well, were you to insult these....well it's not important what they are really, if you were to insult or enrage them though you are truly in for a bad experience.

It might be a good idea to take proper precautions after doing this sort of thing as well, sweep the house of any residual energy left over. If you need more info on that Google smudging.

No actually this isn't a flaw, it's brilliant! Evil, but brilliant... Of course tons of people are going to try it, it's like when you are climbing or flying really high and someone says "don't look down" and of course you immediately DO look down because you just can't help yourself...

However I for one will NOT be trying this, mirrors and candles are not allowed in FUCKTHATVILLE (the reason they are banned of course is to prevent games like OPs)

I will be checking r/nosleep repeatedly starting at 4:35AM to see if any of the people who do try it survive...

Good luck, let the games begin, the may the odds be forever in your favor!

Hey OP :) just wondering what country you're from? I live in Australia and we've done this - but I have never heard it called Three Kings. Also we weren't so over the top with fail safes but I think that's because the version passed onto us wasn't as modern as cell phones! We call it ' alice's looking-glass' ( which I realise has obviously come from Alice in wonderland at some stage) the candle is the same (but no fan) the seats and mirrors are the same ( which I guess is the bare bones of this excersise..) and in looking glass you have to leave the door open behind you. I haven't done this for ages though, Since I've been an adult I've decided not to mess with whatever they are... I'd rather sleep at night thanks!! Still curious though :)

Based on summoning rituals I have read about, the two mirrors become entryways for spirits/demons and you are not to look at them, as possession may occur with eye contact.

Anyway I have a couple questions. What's Shadowside, and what does SHTF mean?

SHTF = Shit Hits The Fan.

The Shadowside is a bit more complex to explain. It's a spiritual plane, I guess. It's not just for ghosts, but anything mental or spiritual (what ghosts are made of), so.. dreams, hopes, fears, nightmares? Not all bad. I've taken some pieces of it and used them to make fiction and games in a different subreddit. Probably safer to think of it that way.

Happy to hear you guys are being entertained!

Where did you hear the term Shadowside? I'm thinking it may have some connection to what I call Hades, where demons are. Second, I've done summonings like this before, and like you said, they're risky. There is usually a combination of words that could break the connection, any idea what they might be?

The title told me not to do it, as seeing as I'm a stubborn douche, I went through with it anyways. I don't believe I did anything wrong, but lets just say that shit didn't go down as planned. I'm really imaginative and love all these stories and 'try this' and shit, so I figured why the hell not.

Right off the bat, I wanted to try this as soon as I finished reading. I read and reread to make sure I had everything perfect. But recently I've been having night terrors. I'm gonna go ahead and blame the fact that I watch to many scary movies lol. The night terrors doesn't usually get to me, but one in particular has been reoccurring. The worse part is that it's one that I've had many times in the past ever since I was little. And wouldn't you know it that by not getting a full nights rest the night before and sleeping for only 3 hours the next day would lead to really vivid dreams lol.

The dream goes like this. I'm back in high school and just got home. I'm upstairs in my room when I hear my mother calling me to come downstairs, "Andre, venha aqui!"("come here" we speak portuguese). I run down the stairs in my usual fashion and turn towards the kitchen. When I'm about to enter the kitchen a hand grabs my arm and pulls me aside, it's my cousin and he has a nail going through the top of his head. My body freezes in horror while he tell me to run and get out. His voice is nothing but mumbles but I get the message and make it for the front door. I get outside and turn around to see if I'm being followed, in the clear, but when I turn back forward there is nothing in front of me, just blackness. --sometime this is when I wake up, but again, I've had this dream many times before and it sometimes ends differently. Usually with the feeling of falling. But not this time-- I look back towards the door and nothing's there. I'm in the blackness and it feels empty and cold. I try to scream and nothing comes out. I open my eyes as much as possible but can't make anything out. I hear my mom calling me again and I freeze. I look around and start to feel the sweat building up. The feeling of being watched is everywhere and I can't do anything but stand there is solitude. Then suddenly a chilling voice from my left shoulder "We're waiting..."

I woke the fuck up man, sweating balls and trembling like a huge pussy. I'll tell you right now that as I laid in my pool of sweat I sure as hell didn't want to do this right now, but after laying in bed for another 10 minutes I was able to calm myself down enough and some up the courage to get this shit done. It was around 3:15ish when I woke up and 3:25 when I made my way to the basement. I took a risk by just telling my cousin to call my cell at 4:34 and being that it's 3 in the morning, I doubt he would have made the 20 min trip to my house. I had my candle at hand and my object of strength being my cross around my neck (it was my god father's necklace and was given to me when I turned 16). I check all the red flags OP told to check, door, fan, cell phone and I couldn't do anything about the 3:30 thing cause I woke up before and don't own an alarm :/

At this point I'm in a strong state of mind and am ready to get this shit on the road. I enter the room and it's very chilly. It's the basement, so no surprise there. I even made a joke about wanting to sleep here next time because my room is usually hot as hell (yeah, I talk to myself lol). I sit in my throne and god damn man, fighting the urge to look at those damn mirrors was like not staring at tits at the beach, f*cking hard lol. While focusing my sight above the candle light for around 15 minutes I heard a sigh. instantly putting the hairs in the back of my neck on end. I looked at the floor just below the candle and saw a pair of shoes on my left. Getting an instant jolt of fear, my body was not shot up with adrenaline. I take a glance at the floor to my right and see nothing, so again I try the left and see nothing this time. I sat there for around 20 more minutes going through the dream in my head. Probably a bad idea because it put me even more on edge. Finally I couldn't help it so I glanced quickly to my left and saw something. More scared then ever, I instinctively stole another glance. It was a figure sitting back on the chair. Legs spread wide with it's arms dangling and it's head tilted to the right side. I've never felt fear like this before, my mind went numb and body felt heavy. When tried to say something nothing came out. I grabbed my cross around my neck and squeezed it tighter than I've ever squeezed something in my life. Then, I swear on all that is good in the world, it said "We're waiting..." I darted off of my "throne" and tripped over the fucking bucket in front of me. Scrambling to get back on my feet I kicked the bucket and knocked some shit off the shelves. Shit started falling over and the door opened. It was my cousin. He said he was trying to call me since 4 because he couldn't remember the exact time. And me being the genius, I usually have my phone on either silent or vibrate, this time it was silent (lucky me).

He helped me to my feet, and I can only imagine what I looked like lol. On the floor looking half dead covered in water while holding a candle. The look on his face was more serious then I've seen. In all my panic, not once, did I think of checking my phone. Needless to say, I didn't go back to sleep, instead we went to McDonolds and feasted like kings while I explained wtf I was doing lol. I got out of the room at around 4:20-4:30, not really sure. I'm not one to believe this sort of thing, and I'm pretty sure this isn't what was suppose to happen. I blame my experience solely on the fact that I was running on 3 hours of sleep and had my worse nightmare just before.

Would I do it again? Probably, just not under the same circumstance lol P.S. Don't mind my terrible ass writing and spelling mistakes lol

What if.. The fool and the queen just happen to be two other people who are trying the same game and are connected by another dimension via the ritual. So instead of spirits, you are just communicating with two other people in two different houses, facing their north.

She should wait until after 4:34; if she comes in before she runs the risk of looking in the mirrors.

Yes, if the candle goes out before 4:34 the connection is lost -this is a good thing, and it's there by design as a failsafe. The thinking is that if anything sudden happens, the fan will blow it out. As long as you're sitting there peacefully, the candle will not go out and the show may go on.

If you look in the mirrors, you will make direct eye contact with your visitors. You do not want that. The ritual is an invitation to unseen forces, but it is on your terms. Your fragile terms at that.

The candle is the only way you can see them, it is the beacon of communication. They understand that the game ends if they make the candle go out.

I would not try this if you do not have a powerful mind/willpower. You will have an enemy and a friend in the room. You only invited two, however. This is why the two chairs are important.

If you do not feel powerful, then you aren't. If you aren't, and you try this, you will most definitely have a very bad time.

3:33 is not when the devil comes out per se. Its the begining of "the demonic witching hour." For one hour of the night demonic forces have a heightened ability to make contact with us. Especially those of us willing to open the door to them. Its not open to only demonic forces but to spirits as well.

The only reason why I won't do this is because all the darkness, mirrors, and suggestive themes are the ones who would make my mind go crazy with delusions and stuffs that will scare the shit out of me. Totally not because I'm afraid of ghosts or spirits. Your brain is the most fearful thing that can haunt you.

When I was younger I'd have this recurring nightmare most nights, I won't go into the details of it, but while I was falling asleep and when I woke up after the nightmare, I'd always have the same feeling all over my body, sort of as if I wasn't really connected with it or something. A few year ago I started having this feeling during the day, I thought I was going crazy and started hallucinating a bit. I got the same feeling while reading this post, do you think it's possible I have a connection with this "shadowside"?

is it similar to using a ouija board? i had a psychic tell me never to use them, i have anxiety disorder and very negative things happened to my life after i experimented in contacting other-dimensional supernatural realms. I was drinking too, so thats probably why he said don't drink. It got so bad one night i flooded my bathroom and didn't even know it, until the neighbors in the apartment downstairs notices water leaking into their ceiling.

My aunt and uncle, years ago, lived in a townhouse on the other side of town. Their kids (my older cousins) used the ouija board all the time, and really claimed it was working, moving, without them moving it. They did this a lot, i'm not sure for how long. The eldest male was walking home one night around midnight later that year, he got the shit beat out of him by a gang, and had to go to the hospital for a long time, no one recognized him. The second son later broke down into a psychotic episode, ran through a plate glass door in a psych ward, claiming he was running from the devil. He's been on different medications for years, and can barely get out of his parents basement. he's in his 30's now, barely functioning. Their mom, my aunt - an interior decorator, opened a door and fell into an unfinished basement without stairs, had to be in a wheelchair, and had cancer, which she later beat, thank god. Their sister was younger, and I suppose was spared, nothing too terrible has happened to her. After these events started happening my aunt and uncle left that townhouse, moved to the other side of town to a clean, newer house, and started new, new furniture, new art, anything to not remind them of the previous house. Needless to say, they burned the ouija board and will never let that kind of evergy or "game" happen near them ever again.

I never played ouija, maybe once when i was younger, but i cheated, i was the one moving the spade. I did feel I was able to contact spirits, especially in meditation, lying on my back, staring at the ceiling. i sort of saw waves, of light, except it wasn't lighting anything up, it was energy.

I'm never heard voices though. you just feel them.

They put me on an antipsychotic after i started getting manic, feeling my grandfather's spirit watching over me, talking about knowing what is coming in the future, seeing warning signs everywhere that this world is coming to something huge, really soon, that it's all connected. Those kinds of abstract "revelations" in my mind led me to the hospital, and life has been sort of rough since. I think I invited something dark in at one point, and didn't notice. I'll do anything to just... sit out my bad karma or whatever and let the panic and stress and anxiety just leave my system, but unfortunately they say i may be having these symptoms forever. Thank god i'm not diagnosed schyzophrenic though, they don't really know what i have, but some of my friends did really think i was on the path to being schizophrenic at one point.

TL;DR: (i dont know what that stands for BTW)... Be careful. Don't play ouija boards. There are some amazing things to be felt and believe are real until it takes you to a dark place that you will have to live with for years, perhaps for life, usually psychotic symptoms.

Coming from a diagnosed schizophrenic who has also seemed to have alleged foul contact with unseen forces, I can relate.

About three years ago I opened my mind up to a spirit I thought was my grandmother's. It turns out, it was the most malicious, demented peace of scum I've ever had the displeasure to mix consciousness with.

It trailed me my entire sophomore and junior year of high school. It would thrive on my teenage emotions (breakups, pent up anger, etc.) but it would have no power over me when I was balanced emotionally or just happy and hopeful.

For a while I was in a low place, and I didn't care if it took over. That is the worst place to be, just in that, "Fuck it I don't even care." mindset. Things got bad for a while.

I ended up manning up and pulling myself together, getting tired of it, and started pushing it away.

It got very, very angry with me. It liked me a lot, and I betrayed it.

It ended up attaching itself to both my best friend and my girlfriend at the time. He almost ended his friendship with me because of its influence, and she literally tried to kill me multiple times before breaking up with me.

It hit me where it hurts, but I got my revenge.

One day while taking a shower, I felt its presence and I called it to me with all the force I could muster.

I appeared right in front of me, and we stared each other in the eye. It was an all out battle of willpower, and I ended up banishing it to the worst place I could imagine.

I kept repeating, "You are not welcome." "I banish you from my land and my body." and "I am stronger than you because I am alive and you are not. You will not win."

Stuff like that, over and over again, each time more forceful in the name of myself.

Now it doesn't bother me anymore. No spirits do. Sometimes I feel it's presence, and I laugh at it in mockery. It has to live its entire existence knowing it could not have me or kill me while I lived. My laughter stings it worse than anything imaginable.

So bud, the moral of this is to not give up hope. Awaken yourself, and realize how powerful you are. I have hallucinated and heard voices, I have been declared legally insane by a professional.

But I am fully functioning. I have a job. I haven't needed medication in months. And nobody but my closest of friends even know that I have a disease.

Whether or not demons are even real, or of I was just seeing things, I will never pity myself or fail to understand what I am capable of. And neither should you.

Make yourself strong. The anxiety will go away. The fear and doubt will desinagrate. You will feel as if you are made of golden light. And if you believe you are, then you are.

There is no God. Do not believe in him. Believe in yourself. And you will become your own god.

Well guys, I can say I did this, I know I was on the chair on 3:33 exacly and I was sitting there, candle was lit, fan was on and door was open. After I sat there for about half an hour I tought I heard something, a voice challenging me to look to the right, into the mirror. While on my left I heard a peacefull voice of a young lady, begging me to stay put and don't look at my right. So I listened to the "lady," and then something grabbed me on my right, pulling my shoulder and by now it started yelling, ordering me to look right. Like the idiot I am I told it to fuck off. Bad move I guess. My friend bursted in at that moment, turned on the light and told me it was 4:34 so we got to our rooms. The next morning I woke up I felt pain on my right arm, so I went to check it, turns out I have several cuts on my upper arm. I didn't think any of it. About 3 p.m. My friend still wasn't downstairs so I went to check on him. When I got to his room I saw it was a mess, nothing was on the place it was supposed to be, his drawers open, clothing pieces all over the floor. But then when i approached him I saw cuts on his right arm. I wp and he couldn't sioke him ut up because of the pain. When he finally could sit up again I could see the damage. His arm had deep cuts, his fingers were broken, and he had HUGE cuts on his chest, leg, and back, (all on the right side) it was like he was tortured. He was also in a puddle of blood, it dripped past his bed on the floor, lucky he has wooden floor so I could clean it up properly. And now as I'm writing this I realised when I checked the time on my phone after we were done with the whole thing it was only 4:30. (im in the hospital now, so I'm sorry for any spelling mistakes as iam on my phone,) He might be in serious danger, I feel like it's my fault because I have come up with the whole thing.

EDIT: He's out of danger now, he was just released from the hospital and he can barely walk or do anything basically.

People I used to hang with, when I was young. Some of them I met in juvie, some I met online. Informal communities. Three Kings had never been written down that I know of, so I figured it would be nifty for this subreddit. It's a variation on an old workhorse, the-candle-and-mirror play, but with a few accessories tacked on, learned the hard way.

However I for one will NOT be trying this, mirrors and candles are not allowed in FUCKTHATVILLE (the reason they are banned of course is to prevent games like OPs)

I will be checking r/nosleep repeatedly starting at 4:35AM to see if any of the people who do try it survive...

Good luck, let the games begin, the may the odds be forever in your favor!

I am here to warn you: The invitations will seem rather amusing and the promises will speak wonders to your ears. Do not listen to them nor accept them. Do not turn to them. Do not start something if you don't intend to end it the way it's supposed to end, and never open a door you can't close.

Well, maybe not so with the candle. If it goes off before 4:34, then the show is simply over and nothing more happens. In theory.

This sounds like spiritual disassociation. I've done shit like this, and it's fucking creepy. You don't look into the mirrors because doing so will reveal the disfigured monster that you really are. Sensory deprivation is like that. I chugged my share of cough syrup in my youth to know that ego death is a powerful fucking thing. Tread lightly, but don't expect anything more divining than a bottle of nyquil or a gram of ketamine.

What would happen if you decide to just leave without a loved one coming to get you? What if they forget/fall asleep at 4:34? Are you entering another realm or are you completely aware of being in the room? I'm extremely intrigued but I just moved from a pretty evil house into a peaceful one so I'm not totally sure if I want to risk bringing something in. I know you don't want to spoil anything but if you could PM me some more info before I decide to dive in headfirst. I've got a few questions for the other side....

[RECIPE] The shoe-box telephone
Approved Rituals

Some background: while I contributed some details, this game was already being played by many in juvie before I arrived there. You have to understand that it wasn't uncommon for these kids to be missing one or both parents, so I speculate that doing this maybe brought some measure of comfort or relief to them (although a few times it made things a lot worse). In any case, for the purposes of this post I will switch to my "believer" hat, stop theorizing the psychological reasons why this works like it does, and simply tell you the recipe as we played it way back when. I think it's lower-stakes than Three Kings, way less dramatic, and perhaps something you should start with if you've never tried anything paranormal before. A get-your-feet-wet kind of thing.

Alright, let's get us a ring-a-ding from the shadowside then.

Ingredients:

You'll need:

    Your phone booth: a closet will do.

    Your handset: a paper cup.

    Your telephone box: the titular shoe-box.

    Your telephone wire: just a regular string (the sewing kind). About 2 to 4 feet should be enough. You'll need a needle too.

    Scissors.

    Some strong object to power the telephone box with; it must have a personal connection to whomever you're trying to talk to. This is very important.

    A single sheet of paper, a pen, and some sort of flat surface to write on.

Setup:

The outbound call:

    Wait for the end of your day, right before bed time. Everything that you were going to do that day is either done or is not, but for now out of the picture, and out of your mind. For now it's just you and the night, just you and your thoughts, alone in your room. Don't turn off the lights but do turn off your cellphone, your TV, your stereo, radio, computer, etc, etc. You want zero distractions, and absolutely no interruptions. You want quiet. Then just wait for the "right time". What's the "right time"? It's... one of those things that are hard to describe but you'll just know it when you see it. You'll just know. It may build up gradually, but when it's finally there it'll hit you; zero doubt. Only at this point may you begin writing your letter. If this threshold of certainty never comes within an hour, just go to sleep and try again the next night. If you've been trying for three or four nights already and the moment just never comes, then it may simply be that you're not ready for this. That's okay. Try a different person, or give yourself a break for a few nights. What you don't want to do is write your letter while in doubt. That'd be a wrong number.

    When you do begin writing don't erase nor correct any mistakes you make (this includes scrawling words over; don't). Don't start over either -you only have a single sheet of paper and your first draft is your final draft. It's ink. Explain to this person why they should give you a ring. Be honest. My personal advice: let it all out. It's not always easy. Don't overthink it; just write. This is why you had to wait for the right time. It'll all make sense. Again, doubt = wrong number. Never dial a wrong number; it's best to abort the whole thing.

    When you're done tie one end of the string to the power object, and using a needle, insert the other end through the center of the bottom of your paper cup. Remove the needle, tie a little knot, and now you have a cute little paper telephone like you probably once made while you were a child. Don't prepare this ahead of time before your letter. Write the letter first, then do the paper cup.

    Read your letter aloud, into the paper cup. Read it sincerely as if the person at the other end could hear you, including all the mistakes you didn't correct. Just read them. This is your outbound call.

    Place the object and letter in the shoe-box, and place the shoe-box on the floor of your phone booth, your closet. Then close the box but don't seal it -just let the lid rest there gently, with the string still coming out from under and going to your paper cup. Leave the paper cup standing on top of the box. Leave the scissors on the floor next to the box.

You're done. Now all that's left to do is to wait for the ring.

Showtime

The inbound call:

    The ring will come in a dream, either that night, or some night shortly after. You will dream of the person trying to call you, and you will wake up from that dream, usually in the middle of the night, and you will know it's time to take the call.

    Don't turn on the light. Don't say a word. Just get up from the bed and go to your phone booth. Is the box still closed, with the paper cup standing on top? Good, get in the closet, sit down, and slide the door closed -a closed booth is particularly important in case the ring comes after sunrise, because you'll need the darkness. If you find the box open, or if you find the paper cup knocked over, abort the mission and snap off the string -don't take that headset anywhere near your ear. Use the scissors if you can't snap the thread with your own hands... it happens.

    Otherwise just sit on the floor there and press the paper cup to your ear and cover your other ear with your other hand -this will help you listen. It may take a while. You may not speak. Don't move too much. Keep covering one ear with one hand and the other with the headset. Don't touch the box. Some people report an increase in call quality after tugging on the string ever so gently -this is fine but just be careful NOT TO OPEN THE BOX by doing so. Remember they're calling collect, and if it goes through, that shoebox must remain closed for at least a few months. Again, you may not speak -not even if you are asked questions, not even if you're ordered to. You already said your piece at the outbound call; for the inbound one just listen. Avoid noise. When you're done (or if you want to hang up at any time), simply hold the box lid closed with one hand, and pull on the headset with the other hand until the string snaps off (use the scissors in case of emergency). Keep the closed shoebox somewhere safe for a few months (oh, and remember to dispose of that paper cup later, too. Burning is fine; just don't put it to your ear again).

What if after three or four nights the ring never comes? Maybe they have nothing to say to you. That's okay. Try another person. Don't do this too often.

Disclaimer: This may help you get closure, but it could also make things worse. I have my theories about this, which actually prove (to me, at least) certain facts in the skeptic vs believer spectrum, but I'll share those after a few experiences, if any, are posted.

EDIT: I'm having some issues posting new comments, I type them in and they don't show through.

My response to contacting God through the shoe-box telephone:

    Sorry, I did not mean to be flippant -I apologize for that.

    I do not believe any entity exists that matches all the qualities commonly attributed to "God", so that makes me technically an atheist.

    But if entities do exist outside our own minds, then there's no reason why any one of them couldn't present itself as a deity to you, and even believe it. Why would it do that, and what would it tell you? No idea. I don't think there's a way to predict that, but my screenwriter side kicked in and figured it would make for a great story -whichever way it went. If you do try this, I wish you the best of luck.

Does it have to be a shoe box or can we just use a small box with a lid? Does it have to be a paper cup or can it be made of other material? Does it have to be sewing thread or can it just be a thin thread? Oh and if the closet is very dark how do we see what we're writing? I don't think I can write in complete darkness.

Sorry for the questions, this seems like something I can actually do and I wish to try it soon. I will definitely post my experience if I do.

I think it can be any small box with a lid, and a cup of any material, and any kind of thread you can work with.

You write the letter during setup. You only go in the closet during showtime, after the "ring". I wish you the best of luck if you try this.

Oh okay, thank you very much! I assume then for the "ring" we have to sleep in darkness. I have a slight fear of the dark and sleep with a light on, but it's very faint and would not illuminate my closet. Would this be okay or do I need to turn everything off completely? My sincerest apologies for the questions, I just want to make sure I do this correctly.

No need to apologize about the questions -I understand your intention to do this right. Since the "ring" is a dream, you need to sleep in a way natural enough for you to make dreams possible. In your case that could mean your usual light, in other people's case it may mean their usual darkness -whichever state allows you to dream is the correct thing to do.

Woo! Another recipe from Fable! This one sounds really nice and much more personal. Something that I feel I could do, unlike a lot of these other ones on this sub.

I have a couple of questions though! It definitely needs to be someone that you knew, right? Not someone who died before you were born, but you would still like to speak to? Also, for the personal object to power the telephone....it should be something that definitely connects strongly to them, not something that reminds us of them, or that we feel strongly about in terms of the person we're trying to call? I ask because an immediate family member died before I was born, but I oddly feel a connection to this person, and other family members have pointed out what they saw as odd connections, and I just thought it would be nice to actually hear from this person, if that is at all possible.....

Anyway, thank you for this recipe!! I can't wait to hear from others about their experiences! You should also give us more information about your theories/proof, because I know I'm not the only one interested in hearing them.

Hey! Yeah, I think this one is a bit more accessible, lower-stakes, perhaps lower-risk, potentially very meaningful, it was a starter. I'm a little bit afraid of people getting wrong-numbers though, but I guess there's just no way to eliminate that risk, other than not playing...

Both your questions are really good, and related to my theories, I think. I'll definitely post more, but what I want to say now is that belief is key. This is also why I emphasized conviction so much, during the writing of the letter. The personal object is a symbol, it doesn't hold power by itself other than what you choose to give it via your conviction. I think any person could be reached if you have the right symbol, and whether a symbol is right or not depends more on its meaning than on whether or not it made physical contact with the person. We're trying to reach the non-physical aspects of that entity after all, so cognitive link has to weight more than a physical link.

Best of luck if you try this, I hope it goes well!

You decide how many nights are enough to wait for a ring. After you give up, the shoebox loses its special meaning and you can treat it like you would any ordinary object.

If a call does come through keep the box closed for at least a few months. I'd rather not speculate yet as to why, but I'll post my theories after a few experiences.

I once had an aunt or someone who told me about something similar to this. Instead of a telephone,tu were just supossed to write a letter to the dead of your choice and place it under your bed. You could pray and the 'postman ' would know to pick it up and deliver it for you. If the letter disappeared, your mail was delivered. Something like that. I don't remember how you would receive an answer though.

This idea really intrigues me. I think I'm going to give this a try for sure, but not with God but the Triple Goddess from the Wicca religion. I'm not sure if I would ask any of the big questions but I definitely want to see if this is possible. Of course I shall inform everyone of my results.

personally im not a religious fanatic (nor an atheist) but if there are some entities they could be/are good bad neutral ( like angels , demons ghosts and other sorts of names that people invented). So we could say that the strongest good entity might be something that others call "God" that/who knows something/everything/everyone .. I have so mnay things on my mind but my english is poor to explain it ... shortly if you believed in something like this and without doubt you would write a letter with few questions and would get a call .. Would you be an atheist ? .... I really dont want to mess with these things couse i have some sensitive friends who told me to never ever try to contact nothing so this is just phylosophical ... maybe there is a redditor who has same thoughts as me but is not a chicken ( like me)

I'm sure a knife would be fine, but to be perfectly honest, it's a little bit more dangerous than scissors. I'm not necessarily saying the telephone voice will compel you to do anything weird, but maybe it's just a concern about fumbling around in the darkness with a sharp object while you're not at your 100% cognitive best.

As for the closet, I honestly don't know. Back then it was a janitor's closet, and we always shut it closed. I say experiment and see what happens. My guess is that it would not matter provided the room is both noise and light free.

I don't think there would be a lot of ambiguity with a legitimate ring. If you wake up and feel in doubt, it was probably not a ring. If you wake up and feel certainty, then it probably was.

Most of us can't remember our dreams, but some who do report they had very specific dreams, too.

[RECIPE] The Doors of Your Mind
Approved Rituals

It's pretty simple actually. Nothing as hardcore as the three kings stuff (which I would actually never do myself) buuuut I saw something on here that reminded me of this game I played when I was little. You only need a friend (and maybe a pillow if you'd like?). But the results can be a little surprising and there are a few warning signs to heed when exploring the doors of your... mind. -cue twilight zone music-

So here we go:

Dim the lights, and light a few candles. The name of the game is to put you into a nice meditative state. You need to be relaxed and be able to have a free mind. This is most important for this to work. So put on some comfy clothes and reeeeeelax. The only useful door to your mind is an open one.

Next, Lay your head in your partner's lap. Pillows are always nice. Make sure your head is facing up. Your friend will need to rub both of your temples in slow, circular motions. Like a massage. It needs to be relaxing. That is key. Make sure they keep a pretty steady tempo. Much ado about trancing and meditation.

Third, This is where your friend will have to guide you, so to speak. Let your mind/ imagination do all the work. This entire time your eyes will be closed, and you will be relaying descriptive information to your partner about your surroundings and such (Suggestion: have a third person recording?) Never second guess what comes to mind. Simply answer your partner's questions without hesitation, as they come to you. Just let it happen.

Here is what your helper should start you with:

"You are at one end of a very long corridor. There are numerous doors on both sides of this corridor, spanning the entire length. I want you to explore these doors, and the rooms behind them. Describe to me what you can see, hear, touch, and feel with great detail."

And from there, the exploration is up to your mind.

TIPS/WARNINGS

-always pay attention to the door first. This will give you a clue as to what waits for you inside. Note doorhandles, any imperfections, unusual color, shape, size. Also the temperature of the doorhandle may or may not be important.

-IF YOU GO INTO A ROOM FULL OF CLOCKS, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY (or try to...). I don't know what the reasoning behind this was (it was years ago, I apologize), all I know is that it was a big deal. You could stay if you wish, but don't say I didn't warn you. You probably shouldn't touch any of the clocks either... Just don't say I didn't warn you. Anybody have an idea why a room full of clocks would be bad?

-This isn't going to be helpful, but I remember something bad about seeing old ladies, too. -shrug- Anybody have ideas about that as well? Again, this is just stuff I remember from being a kid.

-Not all things in your mind are benevolent towards you. I'm pretty sure you know that, hanging around here. But I thought I'd remind you. It's good to ask "yourself" questions, sometimes these manifested characters can be quite revealing... but other times they can just bring you down.

-Follow your gut instinct about certain doors. Sometimes curiosity really does... kill the cat. :(

-check what's on your person. describe what you are wearing. Check your pockets. You might have keys, trinkets.... anything. You never know. They might be useful in your exploration, or at the very least, symbolic.

-Be forewarned... I have experienced the inability to remove myself from this dream-like state. True story: during one of my door sessions a character locked me in the room and my sister had to shake me violently to awake me.

Happy exploring!

I did this with some friends in high school many years ago! One friend knew how to...hypnotize?, I guess, people basically by having them lay their heads in her lap, while she massaged their temples - something very similar to this ritual - and tell some sort of very weird, but calming story. When she was sure that they were "hypotized" (I'm still not sure that's what is was exactly), then she would start asking the person questions about "doors" that they should be seeing, and walking them through some of them.

The only session that I witnessed ended in the friend she "hypnotized" sobbing while still in that state, and she didn't wake up for quite a while, even after we were shaking her quite hard, and yelling her name and telling her to wake up. It was an extremely freaky experience, and I was only an observer!

The best I can think of is get relaxed and begin to meditate. When you feel you've quieted your mind enough, begin to visualize the hallway full of doors. Since you don't have someone to guide you, just try to be as aware as possible and remember as much as possible. I suppose that's the best I can explain it, sorry if that doesn't help!

Clocks... Could be the brain's circadian (sp?) rhythm, so disturbing the clocks (which becomes more likely the longer you stay in there) could change your wake-sleep cycle from, say, a 25 hour clock to a 25 year clock? Just a guess

[RECIPE] The Doors of Your Mind
Approved Rituals

It's pretty simple actually. Nothing as hardcore as the three kings stuff (which I would actually never do myself) buuuut I saw something on here that reminded me of this game I played when I was little. You only need a friend (and maybe a pillow if you'd like?). But the results can be a little surprising and there are a few warning signs to heed when exploring the doors of your... mind. -cue twilight zone music-

So here we go:

Dim the lights, and light a few candles. The name of the game is to put you into a nice meditative state. You need to be relaxed and be able to have a free mind. This is most important for this to work. So put on some comfy clothes and reeeeeelax. The only useful door to your mind is an open one.

Next, Lay your head in your partner's lap. Pillows are always nice. Make sure your head is facing up. Your friend will need to rub both of your temples in slow, circular motions. Like a massage. It needs to be relaxing. That is key. Make sure they keep a pretty steady tempo. Much ado about trancing and meditation.

Third, This is where your friend will have to guide you, so to speak. Let your mind/ imagination do all the work. This entire time your eyes will be closed, and you will be relaying descriptive information to your partner about your surroundings and such (Suggestion: have a third person recording?) Never second guess what comes to mind. Simply answer your partner's questions without hesitation, as they come to you. Just let it happen.

Here is what your helper should start you with:

"You are at one end of a very long corridor. There are numerous doors on both sides of this corridor, spanning the entire length. I want you to explore these doors, and the rooms behind them. Describe to me what you can see, hear, touch, and feel with great detail."

And from there, the exploration is up to your mind.

TIPS/WARNINGS

-always pay attention to the door first. This will give you a clue as to what waits for you inside. Note doorhandles, any imperfections, unusual color, shape, size. Also the temperature of the doorhandle may or may not be important.

-IF YOU GO INTO A ROOM FULL OF CLOCKS, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY (or try to...). I don't know what the reasoning behind this was (it was years ago, I apologize), all I know is that it was a big deal. You could stay if you wish, but don't say I didn't warn you. You probably shouldn't touch any of the clocks either... Just don't say I didn't warn you. Anybody have an idea why a room full of clocks would be bad?

-This isn't going to be helpful, but I remember something bad about seeing old ladies, too. -shrug- Anybody have ideas about that as well? Again, this is just stuff I remember from being a kid.

-Not all things in your mind are benevolent towards you. I'm pretty sure you know that, hanging around here. But I thought I'd remind you. It's good to ask "yourself" questions, sometimes these manifested characters can be quite revealing... but other times they can just bring you down.

-Follow your gut instinct about certain doors. Sometimes curiosity really does... kill the cat. :(

-check what's on your person. describe what you are wearing. Check your pockets. You might have keys, trinkets.... anything. You never know. They might be useful in your exploration, or at the very least, symbolic.

-Be forewarned... I have experienced the inability to remove myself from this dream-like state. True story: during one of my door sessions a character locked me in the room and my sister had to shake me violently to awake me.

Happy exploring!

[EXPERIENCE and RECIPE (kind of)] I believe it was a Spirit Walk
Approved Rituals

Now my details may be fuzzy; it's been a couple of years. Plus this might not quite fit in here but I think it'll be interesting regardless.

I'll give some background: I'd been dating this girl for a few months and one day she'd asked me if I'd known anything about Spirit Animals and the like. I hadn't, I'd barely touched on such things but I had a casual interest in the occult. So we'd discussed it for a while and they had mentioned that they had been on a so-called 'Spirit Walk' in the past.

Asking me if I wanted to try, I agreed. I didn't need much for this, just a quiet room and a candle. We wound up doing this over Skype, but it apparently works better being in the same room. In a way it kind of works like Doors to the Mind (From what I've read of it).

So you turn off the lights, sit down and light your candle. Have it placed in front of you. What kind of candle doesn't really matter. Granted I could be recommending something dangerous but I was (and still somewhat am) new to these things. Anyways, with that done close your eyes and meditate (I'd been taught to do so by imagining gradually submerging yourself in a pool of water, but whatever works for you).

Once sufficiently relaxed, have your partner say something like 'You find yourself in a hallway, there is a door at the end'.

Take note of the doorway and the hall. Mine was a rather thick wooden door with a round metal grip for the handle, the hallway was white, but lined with winding tree branches.

Once you open the door 'you will find yourself in a room'.

Again, pay attention to the room you're in. Maybe since I was new it was a round room, completely white like a void. Once you settle into your room, they'll say something like 'Look around your room, there should be an animal of some kind' and surely enough, out of the whiteness I saw a wolf. It was pretty big, jet black fur and bright golden eyes.

'This is your spirit animal' my partner said. 'Now look around again and see if there is a person'.

I'd looked around the white void again and... something appeared. It wasn't really a person. At first fear gripped my heart, I thought it was the Reaper almost. But it was a skeleton in tattered black robes, it carried a pole with a lamp hanging off the end of it. 'This is your Spirit Guide, take note of anything they say'. I remember they did say something, but I don't remember what. Some later research and discussion lead me to believe that my Spirit Guide was Charon.

'Now look for a door, it can even be the one you came through. When you open it you'll see a landscape. This will be your future'

There was a door behind my Spirit Animal and Spirit Guide. Similar to the one I had originally came through too. Upon opening it I was met with a path, surrounded by snow and dead trees, I could even feel frosty wind on my face. Apparently it meant... something about a new beginning? I'm not sure.

I'd looked around the internet some time later after we'd gone our seperate ways. I could never find the ritual anywhere. There was articles about Spirit Walks through wilderness and spirit guides and such, but never this. If I rceall they'd gotten the ritual off of someone they knew who was really into this kind of stuff.

Has... anyone else gone through something like this? I might try and attempt it again solo at some stage. I just need to get better and putting myself into a meditative state.

I did this for my younger sister (I said I would do it with someone else but that didn't end up happening so I tried it with my sis) and she.. uhh.. she couldn't see an animal or a guide, so when she went back through the door she was outside and saw a bunch of trees on fire and the sky was completely black but she could see the planets..

Looking for volunteers to do a native american ritual.
Approved Rituals

Yes, it’s exactly as the title says. I’m looking for people who can participate, observe and inspect this ritual and its effects. Now the first question you might think of is; why do I need people to do it? Why don’t I just try it out myself and see the aftermath of it? Is the ritual dangerous?

Yes it is. I mean every ritual has some form of risk. Every game has its pitfalls and punishments. This one however has very minor consequences. I need other people to do it because the experience might vary from ritual to ritual and I would like to record the experience of different people from different backgrounds, different mental and social structures. It’s one of those rituals where every person finds different meaning and interpretation to it.

So what’s the ritual called? No clue. It’s not much of a ritual, rather folklore. A tale passed down from generation to generation. Not mine but from a friend of Native American origin. Before you freak out the consequences of this ritual vary from; at best you might feel extremely energised, full of life and you might have an overwhelming sense of courage and confidence about you. At worst you might have intense and vivid nightmares and possible insomnia for a few days. Also you might develop a fear of animals, especially cattle.

The ritual is extremely simple. All you have to do is find some herbs. They are Uva ursi(Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), Buckbrush(Ceanothus cuneatus) and Ashwagandha(Withania somnifera). Careful with the last one. Its leaves are toxic. Use only the fruit. No stems, leaves or seeds attached to the fruit. Grind them in a mortar and pestle (or possibly blend them in a mixer or grinder or something.) and boil them for a few minutes to make a brownish tea of sorts. It must be consumed every night before you go to sleep. You need to do this for at most a week only so it should be fine. Also a warning that the tea is going to taste horrible. Just drink it.

You will also need the feather of an owl. You must either have plucked it yourself or found it somewhere it is untouched by any other human being. Put this feather under your pillow or carry it on your person before you go to bed. After drinking this tea you will have extremely vivid and graphic dreams. The dreams should depend entirely up to you. One note though. In the dream, if you find yourself making a choice always go for the odd one or the left one. For example if you find yourself in a dense forest and find two paths. Choose the left one. It should progress you faster through the dream to the final conclusion. Keep pen and paper close to your bed so you can write about your dream when you wake up. Describe in detail what you see, what you hear, how you feel, your emotions and reactions to the surrounding or any other effect.

Finally all those who try this ritual, please record your findings and post it on this thread. I would like to see the results and it would help me decipher some things.

I am Native American, may I ask what region did you hear this from because do to the fact that one of the herbs you called out is merely useless in which doesn't have any psycho-active effect, or any affects at all(buckbrush)... js.

The weirdest thing about this ritual I noticed was the advice to always choose the left path. I am part native, I am also somewhat of a shaman, however I never connected this with my innate knowledge to always choose the left path. That is to say I have always done so when in doubt, but had no proper logic why.

What proportions for the tea?

Are you sure about Ashwagandha? It's not native to the Americas. I'm just worried that since these plants don't grow together they won't harmonize well.

I think OP confused Indians with native americans since ashwagandha is a indian herb and the rest are mainly common navajo medicine.

About half a cup. I'd say 120 ml. Just put one berry of the bear berry, one of ashwagandha and one bunch of flower of the lilac with 1/4 cup of water. I probably should've made it more clear in the ritual i guess. My bad.

Yes, i'm sure about the ashwagandha. My friend was quite specific and adamant that these were the herbs i need to use. I've personally tried the tea. Tastes like shit but seemingly no harmful effects till now.

The dreams will be in regard to your emotional and mental state. I believe this tea should amplify your dream state and it's effect but i need more people to try it so i can solidify this conclusion. The tea did that for me. If it does it for more people than the concoction might have something to it.

The leaves of ashwagandha consumed in large quantities will lead to stomach problems and diarrhoea. But the fruit devoid of any stem or leaves should be fine to use. Speaking from personal experience, the tea does not seem to have any side effects to health.

In the Eye of the Giant - visit the depths of your subconscious. 1 or 2 players. 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/FineArtsDealer

In the Eye of the Giant: An informative guide on how to stop being a prat and learn how to properly prepare yourself before you venture into the occult.

First, a shout out to /u/Makayladoesrituals for bringing to attention the fact that people who have no idea what they’re doing often attempt rituals without any actual preparation beyond the “recipe” provided by whatever dubious element devised or disseminated (whole or not) the steps to make a foray into the world beyond our own. It’s a pressing issue that needs to be addressed by someone with a little more practical experience than someone who has called a spectral taxi and gotten the willies spooked out of them by an exasperated entity who is likely quite tired of having ignorant kids from our side treading in its space.

I think I have at least some of these qualifications.

Let me lead off by being as blunt and straightforward as a blackjack to the head: If you participate any of these rituals (with about one reasonable exception I can think of off the top of my head) you are a damn fool and absolutely deserve all the terrible things that might happen to you if you dick up the ritual, or even worse, if you actually succeed in what the ritual was likely created for in the first place. A personal favorite example is the “Midnight Man” ritual which is essentially a checklist of things you SHOULD NOT DO if you want to actually interact with the other side in any safe or reasonable manner. I mean, for the love of god, you write your name in blood and tape it to the door of your house which is the supernatural equivalent of taking all of your credit cards and tucking them into an envelope with 500 dollars cash with a photocopy of your social security card and mailing them directly to your good friend the crown prince of Nigeria.

See, while it definitely rankles my ankles that people still are doing rituals that are completely out of their depth, I’m sick and tired of kids doing a couple of these sketchy-ass rituals, getting spooked by an entity that is likely just shooing you away or perhaps even concerned for your wellbeing, and then whining about how scary the other side is and how they’re never going back and how no-one should ever mess with the supernatural again, etc, etc.

So here’s the deal: I’m a pretty generous dude, so I’m going to help you get started from the comfort of your own home without any of the risks associated with Haunted Hide and Seek and getting out of your own bathtub blindfolded. Keep in mind that what we’ll be going over is some kiddy shit in the grand scheme of things, but it has some strong fundamentals that are absolutely vital to anyone who wants to interact with the other side. Without any further ado, “In the Eye of the Giant”.

Preparation: Though ‘In the Eye of the Giant’ will not put you into any sort of direct contact with the other side, or as I will refer to it from now on “The Strange”, it will serve as a good primer for a lot of the concepts that are ever present there. It’s a good idea to get in the habit of a lot of these things before you step out of your metaphorical house into the also metaphorical world outside it.

    Be sober. The inhibition of the body and mind can be relaxing and pleasant In many situations, but as anyone who has ever tried to play that one Slenderman game drunk can tell you, absolutely fucking horrifying while in a stressful situation. Twenty-four hours sober is often long enough to be in a calm and steady state of mind, and if it’s not, you have a lot of problems you really ought to address before you go diving into The Strange.

    Perform a basic purification of your body before you start. You don’t need anything extreme, but take a shower, wash your hair, brush your teeth, and maybe take a dookie and shave if the mood strikes you. Not only will being clean allow you to relax more easily, but purifying yourself will make it a fair bit easier to enter the right state to interact with the kind of existence you’ll find yourself in over there. These are both things that can contribute to the success of this “ritual”.

    Be tired but not exhausted when you undertake this “ritual”. The vast majority of your experiences will take place at the horizon of your own consciousness, and if you go out like a light during the initial steps you won’t get anywhere fast. REM cycles are your friend and you get those when you are sleeping lightly.

    Make sure you have at least 12 hours set aside. While it’s rare for this whole thing to take too much longer than a regular night’s sleep, you’ll most likely find yourself out for 10 hours or more. Since you never leave the confines of your own mind, there’s no hurry, and it’s very important to take the time to do this right if you’re going to do it.

Assuming that the prep work has been done, beginning this foray into your own consciousness starts with laying down as if you were going to sleep. Instead of thinking about Emma Watson or Chris Hemsworth or how utterly rad a speedboat made of marshmallows might be, you need to mentally envision yourself, descending down a long, spiraling staircase. The staircase is your own, but it’s going to be a long way to the bottom and you’ll hopefully be walking down a bunch more times, so you should get used to it. No matter how long it seems to take, you will eventually reach the bottom. There will be a room with four doors. The doors have varying colors, and the doors will change from time to time. Each door leads to a room with a Giant inside. Each room is different as is each Giant inside the room.

The most important thing you have to remember when you are in the eye of the giant is this: They cannot hurt you. They cannot force you to do anything. You are always in control, even if you do not feel like you are. Each of these giants is a fractal of yourself. They are things you have manifested, forms you have created for concepts and things which can never truly have a form of their own. This sort of nebulous existence makes up a great deal of The Strange, and the faster you adapt to that the better off you’ll be. Since everyone has a different perception of the colors the Giants take, and meanings associated with each color, I won’t refer to the Giants by my colors, but rather, what general archetypes they fill.

First, there is the Gentle Giant. This Giant is the foundation of your humanity. It is every steady thing, every constant in your life. It is a mountain, an endless forest, an ocean floor. This Giant speaks as you would if you were talking to your own child. It is kind to a fault, and can see no evil in the world and those who live in it. The Gentle Giant is a valuable resource in your dealing with other people, because it is blind to the faults of those you love and admire, and dangerous for the same reasons.

Second, there is the Swirling Giant. This Giant is the ever changing whims of your humanity. It is everything the Gentle Giant is not: Passionate, short tempered, rash, intuitive, sharp, and bold. This Giant speaks as you would to your closest friend or worst enemy. It is short-sighted, argumentative, but can see and recognize the smallest details you might have missed and come to brilliant conclusions you might never have arrived at yourself. The Swirling Giant is a dangerous comrade because the advice it gives is often both right and wrong, and the value it provides is always subjective.

Third, there is the Gaunt Giant. The Gaunt Giant is your most flawless reason laid bare. It is a being of cold and infallible logic, and this Giant speaks as you would to a complete stranger. It is utterly devoid of sympathy and will give no quarter with its ruthless insight, but sometimes the most painful truths pave a road you would never have walked otherwise. The Gaunt Giant is a terrifying ally, because many valuable things are belittled under the light of pure logic, and sometimes the correct answer is not the right one.

Fourth, there is the Shaded Giant. The Shaded Giant is everything you like about yourself, your most personal desires and the things you want the most, and speaks as you would to yourself when there is no-one else around. It is entirely unaware of the existence outside itself, but there are times when you are your own best friend, and truly, no-one can know you better than you know yourself. The Shaded Giant is a dubious companion because if one ignores the wants and needs of others, their own wants and need will soon be ignored in kind.

The entire object of this primer is to familiarize yourself with the environments you will likely encounter in The Strange, and to better understand yourself. The giants are all a part of you, like it or not, and learning to utilize them will prepare you for what lies further ahead. While the inside of your head is likely a complicated place, it’s a far cry from the things you will experience if you enter The Strange properly. You should get to know each of your primary Giants. Interacting with them will not only help you with your personal life, it will train you to better resist outside influence, the mental equivalent of spackling the drafty spots near the windows of your mind. One of the most frequent consequences of these rituals is having something ‘hang on’, which can usually be avoided by shoring yourself up before you take a plunge into the beyond.

Ending the “ritual” is just as simple as choosing to leave a Giant’s room and ascend back up the staircase. A good night will afford you a conversation with 2-3 of your Giants, and by the time you wake up the encounters will likely be a little foggy and imprecise. That’s fine, you won’t have actually forgotten anything, what you’ve gleaned has just slipped to the back of your consciousness. Your ability to recall more precisely will come with time, and when you remember everything that’s happened the night before you’ll be ready to take the next step.

I honestly hope I’ve dissuaded some of you from jumping headfirst into the hot mess that is the supernatural. As for the rest of you…

Use your common sense and try and stay out of too much trouble. Good luck.

I agree 100% i have been dabbling in the occult and astral projection meditation and grounding for many years. After reading about these rituals i was curious and even though i have a decent ground and grasp on my own spirit i am very hesitant to go visit the other side without lots more preperation. Dabbling in your own mind and such is one thing, but once u start calling out like a SOS becon into the other side you start pissing off the wrong things then enjoy your time in the villa at your local hospital. Jusy be smart and aware, do your homework, and from my own personal experience look into wicca and similar religons for a solid foundation before you start diving into this stuff. Blessed be to you all.

This isn't exactly occult stuff, similar states can be achieved through meditation and especially high doses of ethenogens. If this works I'd say it is literally as you mentioned, you are tapping into your unconscious. Which is a very strange and abstract part of the brain. When I think of occult, I think more along the lines of sacrificial pacts to higher powers at the cost of giving them something they'd like.

Parlor trick is severly the wrong word. A Parlor trick is something you can show--or at least see that is impressive somehow.

This is really a rather important thing.

One should never, ever, ever dismiss the benefits of being introspective. Knowing one's self--self awareness-- is key to most every form of significant self improvement... and most importantly, especially with this sort of thing... How can you tell that you have changed unless you know who you were to begin with?

If you want a parlor trick, the other 'recipes' that invite creepy stuff to happen, THOSE are parlor tricks. The equivalent of dipping your hand in gasoline and setitng it on fire. Impressive: assuming it doesn't go terribly wrong somehow.

So yeah. this isn't summoning slenderman or whatever, but this is a way better way to get started, with a much stronger basis of not getting screwed up in the future.

This is actually a cool technique (or how else should it be called?) to make your brain show you really awesome dreams.

We chatted a bit (with the sea, yes). 10/10, would dream again.

Shit...um...how badly has one fucked up if, say, they sorta ripped their consciousness into 4 seperate lines of thought out of despiration when they were younger? And those lines of thought are eerily similar to what your giant represents?

I'm autistic, and when I was about 8, I had a huge overload. That wasn't special, it was one of many I had everyday. Except this time I tried to fight it, find sanctuary from the chaos and pain when I overloaded. I'd been meditating since I was very little, but I was entirely self taught, and knew nothing as far as what I was actually doing. I actually tore my thoughts into definable 'lines' so I could follow them easier.

Line one's a little kid, who always expects everything to be always fine and trusts everyone, and loses their shit when things aren't perfect but forgets and forgives near immediately. It is short sited and impulsive, and very, very strong.

Two simply states facts as is, and remains neurtral.

Three observes what the first two think, and attempts to use the information given to it, both facts and emotions in context to reach a decision. Unfortunately one is very hard to ignore when very happy or very upset, and two gets drowned out, with three unable to process it with one taking up so mental resources.

Four Narrates. While 3 can be thought of as the "me" line, I don't view it as such. Four is both what I use to process language (translating to and from concepts to english) and how I retreat when I get overloaded or go into meltdown. I passively observe and narrate constantly with 4, except when speaking. This gives me a better handle on processing and allows me to view the other lines all simultaneously, as I give everything a "second review" with the narration.

How bad did I fuck up with this? Should I be worried?

Still reading through, and quite enjoying it so far. I just have to say, ever since I've been perscribed xanax for my anxiety (roughly a year ago), I've been jumping on every new horror game that comes out cause it takes away that fear. Not saying your "stay sober" advice is wrong, just that well, when your delving into video game spooks, xanax helps. (I'm not condoning drug use, only use if perscribed by your doctor) before this year I hadn't played a single horror game, I watched youtubers or friends play them, now I have alien isolation, the evil within, and penumbra under my belt.

edit- finished reading, brilliant advice for people new to the occult. I remember a similar method for "astral projection" which I've only achieved once for a short time. I will most defenetly try and meet my "giants" tonight. Thanks for the very well articulated and thought out post!

I understand that jumping head first into rituals can be dangerous, especially if you don't know very much about the ritual. When researching a ritual, what are some warning signs to look out for, so that you can know that it's actually a more dangerous ritual? Some are more obvious than others, of course. But how can you be sure that the ritual you are performing is accurate and safe? I'm not talking about the psychological ones, but more of the "other side" type.

I tend to put everything I see on NoSleep on the "Fantasy" or "Could be a Thing" shelves, but this seems like a very interesting approach to meditation! I'll give it a shot!

I've gotten into the habit of trying to examine my own faults so that I can fix them, and this looks like it might be a cool way to help identify some of them

Will definitely be trying this tonight! Very curious as to what my subconscious has to say. I'm a bit sceptical as to whether it will work, at least for me, but I do hope so. Excellent story regardless.

Can one do this ritual several times or is it a one time deal? Also, does the giants speak ones mother language, Swedish for example?

Not OP here, but the Giants and everything around you are you. You should, given the proper preparation and mindset, be able to do this many times over, and your Giants should speak to you in the language you expect them to-- typically your mother language.

I've had similar stuff like this happen when I was really young, never knew there were formulas like this though.

I've got a question, can they follow you out? The one you refer to as the shaded giant has a strange parallel to this voice-thing that's been talking to me for nearly a decade now. It used to just be in my dreams but over the last four or so has been having conversations when I'm awake...

It fucking amazes me that anyone would think this is a good idea. I have pretty much no experience with the supernatural aside from some whispering/other crap that I blame on the Meth-Head Satanist former tenants, and even I know that signing your full name in blood cannot end well in any way, shape, or form. Who the Hell knows whether this Midnight Man influenced someone to post that on the internet, and has been kicking back, spooking kids to spread the "game", and collecting fucking untold numbers of True Names for some sinister purpose? Even scarier, how many before Him could have done something like that and succeeded?

I've just read your previous stories and I'm pretty damn interested. You've mentioned before that magic is real, separate from the influence of a Patron, and different from how most people think of it. What is it, exactly, and where/how does one go about learning it? I'm particularly interested in whether or not humans can do supernatural things on their own, without using rituals to get outside help, even if they're weak in comparison, and how one goes about creating useful Objects.

Then from where do we get the myth of the Wizard, and other practitioners who don't summon Outsiders to do their work for them? Mythology is filled with tales of unusually intelligent animals that gain supernatural abilities, why not humans?

I'd suggest that you look up this book. My dad has met one of the soldiers involved in that program, and he swears that not only was the book correct, but that they were actually getting somewhere.

Normally the condescending attitude would've turned me away. Not that it's a problem of yours; pride is one of my faults, and I don't like for people to act like they know more than me when they obviously do. But I've had an interest in the occult, going on 5 years now, and I had to read on. I'm glad I did, and this is something I will definitely utilize before I try my first ritual.

Do you think studying for 5 years is adequate time to study before trying a simple ritual? The only reason I ask is because, admittedly, you seem to know what you're talking about.

Speak with your Penumbra - the Ego and Super-ego walk into a Bar. Bartender demands some Id. 1 player.

[RECIPE] Speaking with your Penumbra
Approved Rituals

I learned this ritual from a psychologist I interviewed a few years ago. He is a strong believer in the occult and claims to do this ritual once a year. I debated whether to post this ritual, as it is more of a mental exercise then a foray into the supernatural. I decided, however, that the ritual is interesting enough to merit sharing. I am not a psychologist, so take what I about to say with a grain of salt.

Freud once hypothesized that human psyche is divided into three components: Id, Ego, and Super Ego. The Id is the primal part of our nature, and contains a human’s most primitive needs, wants, desires, and impulses—including our sexual and aggressive drives. It is utterly amoral and selfish. The Id is the only aspect that exists at our birth and is the last to linger before we die.

Whether this is accurate or not is beyond the scope of my knowledge. This guide, however, can let you interact with something similar—your “penumbra.” The penumbra is everything you are not. If you are strong, it is weak. If you are humble, it is proud. If you are warm and tender, it is cold and heartless. Each penumbra is unique to its host. There is, however, one common element amongst all penumbras. Each penumbra is utterly amoral and cares for nothing except you. It is blind to the value of the world around it. This myopia, however, makes it your fiercest defender. It will gladly do anything to further your interest.

Unfortunately, your penumbra does not exist outside of you. Thus, it has no power in the real world. It, however, can help you in other ways. First, your penumbra is one of the best resources to understand yourself. It can see past all of the lies you tell yourself and others, for it knows you as well as you know yourself. It has witnessed every one of your memories no matter how private or shameful. It has rejoiced each of your successes and lamented each of your failures. It has even witnessed all of your thoughts. In short, for those seeking to go inward and learn more about themselves, there is no better advisor that exists.

Second, your penumbra can make you stronger by helping you overcome your weaknesses. For example, if you are dishonest, it can make you honest to a fault. If you are a coward, it can make you a lion. All you have to do is surrender some control to it. This is a tremendous power, but is also extremely dangerous for reasons this guide will discuss at a later point.

The instructions below will allow you to exercise both powers. Fortunately, for those interested, this ritual is not particularly difficult. The preparation, however, can be quite inconvenient and uncomfortable.

First, you must not sleep for 24 hours. The idea is to reach the condition where you can no longer fully control your thoughts. The perfect moment is when your thoughts begin to creep in spontaneously and you begin to entertain them without any conscious effort. This state is important because you can only meet your penumbra when the societal conditioning upon yourself dissipates and you are at your most natural state. The 24-hour requirement is just a standard; it should work for most people. Particularly active-minded people will require a few more hours to reach the ideal state. Others with more discipline might require less.

Second, you must avoid all contact with people during this period. It is fine to listen to music or watch TV. You, however, cannot talk to another person in person, over the phone, or via skype. This is important for the success of the ritual. We as humans crave social interaction. When you deprive yourself of social interaction, you force your mind to look for other things to communicate with. The point of the ritual is to convince your mind to talk with your penumbra. Your mind will—and should—never let you communicate with your penumbra willingly. This period of isolation, however, will force your mind to break down this defense mechanism.

Third, you must be mentally healthy and in a good state of mind when doing this ritual. Otherwise, this can be a very bad experience. Your penumbra will not hesitate to manipulate you for what it believes to be in your best interest. Your penumbra is your friend but even friends can believe in “tough love.” Unfortunately, your penumbra—although well intentioned—is often misguided, as it is utterly selfish and does not share any of your concern for others. It is more than happy to see the world burn to win you some trivial gain.

When you meet these three conditions, you are ready to begin the actual ritual.

First, make your surroundings as silent as possible. Then sit and clear your mind for 10 minutes. When you are ready, imagine the narrative below. Do not be discouraged if it is difficult to ease into the scenario in the beginning. It will become easier as you fall deeper into the trance. At a certain point, let go of the narrative below and follow the path your mind prepares for you.

You are in a forest. It is dusk and the sun is setting. The wind begins to pick up. You are returning home.

You come across a shrine. Make an offering and say why you wish to talk to your penumbra. Then move on.

The sun dips below the horizon, but the dying sunlight lingers. You continue to walk. You come across a bridge. Make a sign of respect and cross it.

You find yourself in front of a home. When you reach the home, it will be night and above you a starless sky. Enter the home and await your guest.

At this point, things should begin to come to you naturally. If this is your first visit, try to memorize what you see (i.e. whether the home is modern, the style and layout of the home, furniture, etc.). Each detail represents a different aspect of your psyche. This home is a mental construction of your soul.

Your penumbra should greet you after what feels like half an hour. At first, it should look like a silhouette or be extremely blurred. It might be difficult to discern any of its features or even its outline. Do not waste any time trying to examine it closer, as it is a futile effort. Instead, simply begin speaking with your penumbra. If it does not come, do not fret. Simply end the ritual and try again. If you see anything else, immediately abort the ritual. Do not speak with anything other than your penumbra, whether it be a loved one, imaginary friend, or something else. End the ritual and start over from the beginning on a later date.

Feel free to direct the conversation as you see fit when speaking to your penumbra. No etiquette is necessary, save that what you believe you owe yourself. I recommend you speak to it about your goals, fears, or some past event that haunts you. In addition, make sure to observe its personality and mannerisms during the conversation. For example, if it is patient and tolerant, perhaps you are not despite what you might believe. In this regard, your penumbra can be a tremendously insightful conversation partner in more than one way.

Just take care to treat everything your penumbra says with skepticism. As mentioned above, it is utterly amoral. Although it cannot force you do to anything, it can—and will—lie to advance some agenda it believes to be in your interest.

You can end the conversation at any time. Simply wake up as you would from any dream. Nothing will be different and you will be in the same place you were when you began the ritual.

If you are not content with merely speaking with your penumbra, you can go a step further. You can permit it to share your body and act on your behalf in the real world. For example, if it is charming, you can ask for it to impart its charisma to you. One man supposedly worked with his penumbra to become the youngest CEO of his company. A word of warning for those considering doing this. You must qualify this permission as much as possible. You cannot give it unfettered permission to share your host. An ideal instruction should be something like “I permit you to share my host 1) only when I am in mortal danger, 2) in order to impart your bravery 3) in a manner unlikely to harm either myself or others, and 4) only to the briefest extent necessary.”

Failure to invoke these restrictions can lead to terrifying results. One man asked his penumbra to make him “more assertive.” This man was normally a calm, rational person. Unfortunately, shortly after the conversation he snapped and nearly killed his wife during an argument. Another man disappeared when his penumbra decided to take full control. His penumbra withdrew only after nearly three years. By then, his life was already in shambles. Note that this ritual is still dangerous even if you appropriately qualify the permission you give to your penumbra. Your penumbra imparts its strengths to you by taking control and acting on your behalf when it perceives that you need that particular virtue. It can make mistakes.

If you wish to revoke the permission you gave it, simply say so aloud three times. Your penumbra will no longer hold any power over you. There is no long-term penalty associated with this ritual, and you can repeat it as many times as you wish.

You can, but I do not recommend you do so. Most of the time a penumbra will treat its host with respect, and the ritual will proceed smoothly. However, if the penumbra is particularly aggressive it can try to overpower the person speaking with it. It will persuade and cajole the host in following its agenda. Of course, this is not always a bad thing. It is looking out for you, so it won't make a person throw away their own life. But the outcome will depend on the particular nature of that penumbra.

The worst thing that can happen is that it somehow persuades someone to let it take over, and subsequently ruin his or her life. It can ignore--or worse, exploit--all of a person's loved ones to what it thinks is for the host's benefit. Even worse, if it is particularly malevolent, it would gleefully ruin your own life just for fun.

No, but you are in a precarious situation. When you do this ritual, you open the door to your mind. Its an open invitation for any entity to speak with you. Although most visitors are friendly (or at worst apathetic), there are many fragments of our subconscious who are not quite as friendly. Speaking with them is ill-advised because they will not hesitate to manipulate you for their own ends. Some will pursue you beyond the confines of the conversation and will manifest in the real world as hallucinations. I recommend that you take a "cleanse" for the next three days. Do not drink. Do not generate any undue stress unless absolutely necessary. And most importantly, do not repeat this ritual or commence any other ritual. You should be fine, unless it was something very malicious.

In the explanation you mentioned that you Penumbra is often blurred, out of focus, showing no physical traits at first. So, if it's something other than your Penumbra will it take physical form right away? How would you know you're speaking to your Penumbra if you cannot see what it looks like at first? Should you wait to speak until it's in focus?

I apologize for the delay in responding. I was out of the country interviewing more people and researching several leads I had. In response to your questions:

So, if it's something other than your Penumbra will it take physical form right away?

Yes. This is a major signal that something is wrong. Your penumbra will not have a clear image until well into your conversation. If you find yourself facing something that it is not hazy, immediately end the ritual. There are many predators who roam within our subconscious. Some of these entities are supernatural. Others are not. All are extremely dangerous.

How would you know you're speaking to your Penumbra if you cannot see what it looks like at first? Should you wait to speak until it's in focus?

I was unsure of how to answer this, so I emailed this question to my colleague. He assured me that it would be clear when your penumbra was in front of you. He knew he spoke to his penumbra through one of several signs. Most often, he would feel a strong sense of deja vu. Sometimes he would have a flashback of a past dream he had months--or even years--before. Other times he would smell something familiar from his childhood, like lilac from the fields surrounding his old home.

I apologize for the late response. I waited until I received permission from my acquaintance before sharing his experiences. He was happy to do so to help those interested better understand both the benefits and dangers of the ritual. He has done the ritual many times and has allowed me to share the following stories.

The first time he did this ritual was a few days before applying for his first professional job. His friend--who was a bit of a hippie--said that the ritual would help him "find his way." So my acquaintance took the proverbial plunge into the rabbit hole. He did the ritual and met his penumbra. It was a wizened old woman, equally arrogant and caring. It imparted wisdom with a motherly tone. It was silent unless directly asked a question. The conversation lasted about 20 minutes. He never felt in danger and had no trouble ending the ritual. He used her deliberateness and wisdom to help him excel in his interview and, ultimately, win the job. Following this success, he developed a habit of talking to his penumbra once a year.

About 10 years later, his wife died. This hit him particularly hard. He foolishly decided to do this ritual anyway out of desperation. He wanted the penumbra to take his place in the real world to end the pain of his loss. I suspect he did not care if the ritual went wrong. Perhaps he was hoping it would. Regardless, this time he did not meet his penumbra. He met something else. It took the form of his beloved wife. The entity seduced him with happy memories and offered him a chance to relive those memories for perpetuity. He knew something was wrong. He smelled rot the entire time. It was cold as ice and he felt as if needles prickled him the entire time. Still, in his troubled state he ignored these warnings. He accepted the offer without hesitation. Then the true pain started. The entity tortured him for what felt like decades. It psychologically tormented my acquaintance by having him relieve the moment of his wife's death repeatedly. He tried to leave, but it would not let him go. He doesn't know (or refuses to divulge) how he escaped, but he somehow did only to find that one hour had passed and that he was in the same spot as he was before he began the ritual. He left that experience a changed man.

That experience, surprisingly, did not scare him entirely off from the ritual. My acquaintance began renewing his yearly tradition almost half a decade after his traumatic encounter. Now, however, he takes far more precautions. He limits the use of the ritual as a psychological benchmark. For example, his penumbra is a perpetually grinning knight draped in red brimming with confidence and naivety. My acquaintance interprets this means to mean that he himself remains a broken man. He hopes that observing his penumbra will help him gauge his progress in repairing himself.

[Q + Experience] X/post from NoSleep - The Game of Seven Doors
Approved Rituals

It was suggested that I post this here, as I began recounting memories from my childhood on r/nosleep. Someone mentioned that the game I was recalling, Seven Doors, sounded really similar to some experiences many of you shared on this board. I'm going to re-post my story and then ask if this sounds familiar to any of you and what you all think it might mean? I'm not super familiar with Three Kings at all so please forgive if this isn't the right way to go about this, and any information you can share with me would be much appreciated.

Again, this is a memory that I'm writing in more of a story format due to it originally being meant for r/nosleep, but it's a real memory, so forgive the slightly more literary tone.

The Rules of Seven Doors

Part 1 is copied below but you can also read it here:[Playing the Game of Seven Doors Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4rtg67/playing_the_game_of_seven_doors/)

[Playing the Game of Seven Doors Part 5] (https://wh.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4sjaxf/playing_the_game_of_seven_doors_part_5/)

I’m not sure how we started, or who had the idea first, but when I was in middle school I had a group of friends who would all go into the woods together past the race track and play a game we called “Seven Doors.” This game involved one girl laying her head on the lap of another; the second girl would cup her hands over the eyes of the first girl to block as much light as possible from shining through their eyelids. We would all circle around them, seated on the forest floor, and chant softly, “Seven doors, seven doors, seven doors…” etc.

The girl who’s hands were cupped over the first girls eyes would ask her questions after we chanted for a few minutes. What do you see? Where are you? Do you smell or hear anything? All eading sensory questions that would paint a picture of a location in the minds eye. The girl lying on the ground would begin telling us what she saw, describing what she was doing, even where she was walking. Usually every “session” like this started in a forest similar to the one we played in, except that the girl who was “traveling” would be alone.

Within the woods were seven doors, each one a different color; there was red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, and white. They were scattered, and usually the goal of each session was to find a door, open it, catalogue what was inside of it and get back “safely” to the “entry point”, or the clearing in the woods that all of us originally arrived in when it was our turn to travel.

We only had 45 minute lunches, so we would usually only have time for one person to go under per day. Originally, it was just in fun; we would giggle and chant and listen with rapt excitement and attention at the visual story the girl who was traveling that day would spin for us, finding all manner of animals and plants in the “forest.” We respected the hunt for the doors; no one was eager to slip a discovery into their story until it felt right or made sense. Thus it took us two weeks to find three of the doors and explore a little bit of what was beyond each.

The blue door was found first, and it led to a deep valley lake, with short white houses cut into the cliff sides around the lakeshore. We hadn’t delved deep enough yet to know if the small cliffside villages were occupied or not, and by whom.

The red door led a huge city, built from gold, metallic terra-cotta type material, with towering buildings that connected and re-connected through complex sky-bridges. Again, we had yet to encounter any sort of dwellers or people here, only a few strange birds that followed our progress through the city any time one of us ventured into the Red Door.

The Green door led underground, into a dank, glowing grotto, filled with soft phosphorescent fungus that wove across the ceiling like a webwork of fine jeweled thread. There was a single fire pit with a crackling fire lit at the water’s edge, and a small tent suitable for one or two people at the most further in the darkness.

We were slowly moving beyond the point where it was a game. In the beginning, perhaps we had tapped into the effectiveness of soft repetitive noise and some sensory deprivation by blocking the light from the eyes, and achieved some very mild meditative states. It may have helped with our intuition, our ability to get lost in our world that we all created together. Like a creativity exercise done to stimulate those more abstract portions of the brain that we are so plugged into as younger kids, and lose access to as we get older. Maybe we were just at that right age; not quite children anymore, not quite grown women, but in-between, a gray state of being; transitional creatures each with a foot in two different worlds.

Maybe this is what made us susceptible. Who knows?

I remember going under on a Wednesday, when my turn came around again. My friend, we’ll abbreviate her name to Jay, had her fingers cupped loosely against my cheeks. She had been taking guitar lessons, and I remember how calloused her finger pads were against my twelve year old skin. It made it harder for me to concentrate for a while, to sink into that soft fuzzy half-awake state that made it easier to make up stories. A flash of irritation shot through me but I quenched it, squeezed my eyes shut, and tried to concentrate. The anticipation in the circle around us had changed in the last week. No giggles or smiles; we used to make faces at each other across the circle to try and get one another to crack the chanting with a laugh, but the last few days everyone had intently stared at whomever was on the forest floor, focused. Resolved. There was a mystery here and we were going to figure it all out.

Hindsight is always 20/20, isn’t that what they say? If I could stop my twelve year old self somehow….

Finally, the chanting stopped, and Jay asked me, “What do you see?”

The clearing was around me, as it always had been before. I looked down and could see myself, wearing the flared Dickies and blue-striped, cap-sleeved shirt I had put on that morning. I circled around the clearing, getting my bearings. Our friend S had found the green door the day before, and she had turned twice before heading off into the forest. I was really curious about the grotto so hoped I could find the Green Door again and spend a little more time exploring. I turned steadily, making a second complete circle, before walking out of the clearing into the woods.

It was midday; sun shafts broke through high canopies of thickly layered pine trees. Dead needles and rocks crunched under my shoes as I walked, threading in-between tree trunks and larger ferns. I described the landscape around me in colorful detail, until I was stopped short when Jay asked, “Do you hear anything.”

Huh. Besides my own footsteps, I hadn’t actually thought about sounds yet. I paused, finally tuning in to the forest around me. There was a stillness, a heaviness to the forest that seemed to dampen all noise as if coming from underneath a blanket. I waited, but besides me there was no sound. Not even one of the creatures my previous friends had identified in earlier explorations. My mind was a total blank.

“I don’t hear anything,” I whispered, and somehow saying it out loud filled me with a sudden, blood-chilling dread.

Ice in my veins, I slowly turned in a circle right where I was standing, peering sharply into the woods around me. This was…strange. Something was off. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary, but this weird, suffocating stillness seemed much different from the soft breezy forest we had come to know. I don’t know why I was stupid enough to do this, but I called out, “Hello?”

A pause.

Then, in the distance, a sound. Leaves rustling?

The snap of a branch, so singularly loud in the stillness that it might as well have been a gunshot.

My heart cracked and fire surged through my limbs. I whipped around and began running back to the entry point, the clearing where we all entered and exited from.

Fuck. What was I thinking? I should have realized something was wrong right when I arrived but nothing had ever happened before, so why should it now?

My breathing came fast and hard as I dodged tree trunks and leapt over exposed roots. Jay later told me that I had called out “Hello?” and then started almost hyperventilating. She had been tempted to wake me up right then and there, but we had a rule about waiting until a person had returned back to the entry point before coming back. Something about exiting the same way we had entered, in order to keep everything orderly.

I was mostly looking down at the path as I ran, to ensure that I didn’t trip on a root or large rock. So when I looked up briefly, and saw a dark, hulking shape ahead of me in the woods, my heart nearly stopped right then and there.

“Shit!” I veered suddenly, dodging behind a pine tree, clutching the rough bark in my hands as I pressed myself against the trunk. I stuffed my hand in my mouth, stifling my gasping breaths, ears craning desperately for any sound. What was that? Were my eyes playing tricks on me? What in the actual fuck was going on?

I waited, hearing nothing but the thick silence and my own blood pounding in my ears. After a few moments, I cautiously peered around the edge of the trunk.

It was closer to me now. I hadn’t heard anything, but there, in the direction of the dark hulking thing I had seen earlier, I could make out the distinct rectangular shape of a door.

“What is it? What do you see?” Jay’s voice squeaked a little higher than normal.

“There’a door ahead of me,” I whispered. I stared at it, fingers white-knuckled and stinging with sharp pain as the rough bark of the tree dug into them.

“A door?” A pause, then Jay spoke, her voice calmer, colored with curiosity. “What color is it? Is it green?”

I swallowed hard. “It’s black.”

It stood alone in the woods about 50 yards ahead of me. A dark, solid stain on which the light of the sun seemed not to touch. I couldn’t see much else from my distance outside of a faint embossed pattern covering the center of the door.

There was a long pause. Then, another voice, from the circle of our friends around us. “I thought there were only seven doors?”

“Elia, shhh!”

“Well she’s changing the game! We haven’t even found all the doors we decided to have yet and she’s making more doors?”

I couldn’t be sure…but it was starting look like, somehow, the door was getting closer to me through the woods.

“I’m running around it,” I said, and began moving through the trees, circling around the door to the left. It didn’t seem to move while I was looking at it, yet every now and then I realized that even though I was moving around and away from it, it somehow was closing distance between us. When I realized that in the time it took for me to circle around it, it managed to halve the distance between us, I couldn’t take it anymore. I broke my gaze, turned, and ran full sprint.

I was nearly at the clearing. Just make it to the clearing and get out of here; it’s a door, it’s not like it’s going to chase me-

The trees broke up ahead of me, opening up into the clearing and my way out. I gasped in shaky relief, and slowed for a moment, peeking over my shoulder to see if the door was still “following” me. There was nothing behind me but trees and forest and I almost laughed.

“Guys! I think I lost-“

I turned, and screamed as I nearly ran right into it. It was three feet in front of me, and I barely avoided slamming right into it, throwing myself off to the side into the brush.

“Fuck, you guys,” I cried. “Fuck, fuck! Jay, get me out, get me out!”

“Are you in the clearing?” Her voice was sharp.

I scrambled to my feet, and threw myself around the door, taking off into a hard run. The moment my toes passed the edge of the forest into the grass, I said, “Yes! Yes, get me out, now!”

“Five, four, three, two, one, and…open your eyes!” Sunlight nearly blinded me as Jay’s hands lifted from my face and I scrambled up, frantically brushing dead needles off that had collected on my backside. I was panting. Jay’s face looked pinch as she watched me. No one else said anything for a long time before Elia finally spoke up. “I can’t believe you didn’t open it.”

“Are you shitting me? A creepy black door?” The remembered sight of it chilled me and I shivered unconsciously. “No thanks.”

The bell rang, signaling five minutes until the end of our lunch time. “We’ll try again tomorrow,” Jay said quietly, and without another word, ten girls got up and trudged back towards the school, a strange sobriety having fallen over everyone.

Interesting experience, but you outta add in the rules or instructions somewhere. I know that you have most of them, but checking your posts on /rNoSleep, you mentioned in a reply that leaving early may have unintended consequences.

So we had found 3 doors, but there were seven that we agreed existed or knew about before hand; red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange and white. So when we found the black door, or I guess..when it found us, it was an extra door that wasn't supposed to be there, or wasn't a part of the original plan. That's why Elia said what she did; she initially assumed that I was making up an extra door.

Someone in another thread made a really great point that I am not actually sure you've addressed--you mention at one point that you agreed ahead of time that there are seven doors, which would line up nicely to each of you getting to "create" a door. You mention the names of seven girls at some point, but then you specifically mentioned ten girls leaving.

I'm going to find their username to link it, but they suggested that you may have picked up something extra (aka a "drifter") since you haven't named more than seven names, and have ten girls in your group at some point.

I'm pretty freaked out to see this is cross posted here, since that means it's possibly true. 🙃

Yes I've been following their theory but didn't want to spoil future stories by responding yet. But...I am having a really hard time remembering everyone else's names, to be honest. :( I could just make up names, because I specifically remember 10 girls who played, but I think perhaps because of this theory I'll just point out that I only remember my friends Emory, Elia, Jay (Jessica, but we all called her Jay), Aubrey, Shina, and Lauranne. I obviously remember my own name, so that's seven names. It's been 20 years, so it could mean nothing, or it could mean something.

Edit: And yes, while I know on r/nosleep everything is assumed to be true, this is actually a real experience from my childhood and not fiction. I've sort of fleshed it out to make it more story-like, but it was a real thing.

I am curious: it sounds as if you girls had something akin to a shared experience. You listened to each others' and built your mindscapes off of each others' stories. Is this correct? That you essentially helped each other explore what you thought was the same area?

Also, could you move your recipe instructions from the bottom of your post to the top? I think that is better from a formatting perspective. Thanks!

Yes this sounds about right! So the idea was that we were all starting in the same point (the forest, in a clearing) and that there were rough "Rules" that we had to all abide by in order to keep the story connected and coherent. If something changed then everyone would operate in a way to acknowledge that the change had happened for their projection of the forest as well. Originally it felt much like the game "And then..." where you create chunks of a story and then hand the story off to the next person and they would continue it; but this had some light meditation and possibly altered states involved and I feel like towards the end it was changing a lot, like we weren't necessarily always in control of what was happening.

(reposting from r/nosleep so you get the answer in both places.)

The woods were a part of the school grounds; they were right next to our track and there was a good stretch of forest with little mini walking trails. This is in the Pacific Northwest, so technically the woods are a part of everywhere.

Synapse - pose questions to Earth. 1 player.

[RECIPE] Synapse ( Mostly safe.)
Approved Rituals

This is a little something I came across while sifting through my father's old belongings from his childhood. It is supposedly designed to help you get in touch with some of your deeper, untapped energies. From what I can tell, it's a whole lot more low-stake than some of the other various rituals here. There is no risk of extensive bodily harm, although you may recieve an electric burn if you're not careful.

Requirements

    A near by body of water. If you live by a lake or river, or have a pool, great! If not, A bucket of water placed outside (preferrably in a back yard) will do just fine.

    A dark room. This can really be anywhere, because the ritual will be performed at night. However, no windows is optimal.

    An object with strong personal meaning. Make sure you can successfully tie a piece of string a round it. This is your "Destination".

    A battery. Either AAA, AA, C, or D. See the preparation for info on how to pick the type. This is your "Origin".

    A piece of string or yarn, 2-3 feet in length. This is your "Connection".

    A coin. Doesn't matter what kind, just make sure it's clean, and has a clear heads/tails.

    Some sort of alarm. It could be your phone, or a friend with a frying pan, whatever it takes to wake you up.

Preparation

Start preparation at high noon, 12pm on the dot. Place your destination (power object) somewhere easily accessible, so it can be gathered quickly. Find your battery. The battery is a very important component, and the type does matter. The higher voltage of the battery, the more energy your "synapse" will have. More energy means more leverage that the world has to act on your mind. I reccomend AAA for first-timers, and D for daredevilish folk. Dig a small hole next to your body of water. Place the battery and the coin in this hole, and bury them. Do not disturb them until 9pm. This is how you "ask" the earth if you can perform this ritual. Find something to occupy yourself until 9pm.

Procedure

At 9pm, return to where you buried the battery and coin. Dig them up. By this time, the earth has made up its mind, and is ready to give you its answer. Flip the coin, and let it hit the ground. Heads, the answer is yes, and you may proceed. Tails, the answer is no. Try again another night. If answered yes, go inside. The house is the "body", and the dark room of choice is the "mind". Tie the battery to your power object using the string or yarn, and place it in the center of the dark room. This is your "synapse". Turn off all electrical devices/appliances in the room, and shut off all lights in the house. It is time for the body to sleep. Go to your room, shut the door, and sleep. Make sure your alarm is set for 12am, midnight. At midnight, wake up. The mind has awakened. Proceed into the dark room. If the synapse has changed its location, abort immediately. If any electrical appliances or lights are on, abort immediately. To abort, remove the battery from the synapse. Take it outside and cast it into the body of water, saying "You will not dream tonight." Go back inside, and return to sleep. Do not arise from your bed until 9am. If all is in order, proceed into the dark room and lie down in the center. Looking up at the ceiling, place the battery in one hand, and the power object in the other. Do not fall asleep. If you can manage to stay awake with your eyes closed, do so. Otherwise, stare into the darkness. After a few minutes, you should percieve the illusion of the daytime sky. Now is the time to ask the earth any questions you may have. Once you are finished, end the ritual by going outside and casting the battery into the body of water, saying "The mind will return to sleep." Return to your bed and go to sleep. Do not arise until 9am. Your questions should be answered in the form of dreams. They may be cryptic and hard to understand. You should awaken with a refreshed feeling, and have a more positive energy from that day onward.

Precautions

DO NOT:

    Use ANY electrical appliances, devices, or lights until 9am.

    Fall asleep when performing the ritual.

    Leave the house other than to cast away the battery, until 9am.

ABORT IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING EVENTS OCCUR:

    You lose the coin or drop it into the water.

    You wake up on the floor of the dark room. If this happens, abort and leave the house as soon as possible and do not return until noon (12pm)

    You wake up in the morning, without having completed the ritual. If this happens, abort and leave the house as soon as possible and do not return until noon (12pm)

    You see a nighttime sky during the ritual.

    You see or hear anything strange or out of place during the ritual.

Overall, this is supposed to be a low-risk thing, and if you screw up, the consequences will be minor at most. It's just something to try if you feel adventurous or curious. Comment with any questions you may have.

Thanks!

Is there any kind of question you shouldn't ask the earth, in case you end up offending something/someone? Can you ask it personal questions about yourself? It sounds fascinating but I honestly wouldn't know what to ask! Maybe for the lottery numbers, idk :D

You know, I don't really think so. There might be some questions that you won't get the answer for, for reasons unknown. Because you'll be unconcious when getting these answers, and some questions may personal, it's not something that someone can easily post an experience for.

However, if you do want to post something like that, please do, and be sure to share. :)

I'm not entirely sure. It's supposed to give the synapse more energy, and thus more room to get out of control. If you leave the house... I don't know. All I can say is that you are not ever supposed to leave the synapse's energy unattended, because who the hell knows what it might cause.

Fire Breathing - old native american ritual for questioning your subconscious. 1 or 2 players.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/AksysGamer

(RECIPE) Fire Breathing
Approved Rituals

So I recently heard about Three Kings and thought, hey this would be a fun subreddit to read peoples experiences and such.

I am slightly surprised I have not seen this posted here before as well...

First, let me start by saying this is not for the faint of heart. My Native American grandmother is the one who showed me this at a very young age, and it did change my view on a lot of things. Anyways... enough rambling...

Materials Required :

2 Candles 1 Lighter or Box of matches. (box of matches works better as it is older.) 4 mirrors (preferably body length.) 2 chairs 1 Power object (this is to bring you back to reality, Im guessing.) 1 Cell Phone 1 Cell Phone Charger 1 Windowless Room (Can use curtains if needed as this is another sensory deprivation ritual and any noise or light can disturb you from it quite easily.) 1 A clean drug / alcohol free body. 1 a notepad

or

1 a sketchpad (for the more artistic.)

Lastly -

1 compass

Introductory steps -

Set up the mirrors in each direction North, South, East, West. This is why you need a compass ;).

Point the chair you will be sitting in the direction you are comfortable with facing or "drawn" too. This may change at the time of the actual experiment / ritual. Point the other chair in the opposite (obviously ;) )

Put your candle in front of your chair and the other in front of the other chair. This will create opposing reflections and light sources

( for the scientific people, this is a form of sensory deprivation as well. )

Put the notepad or sketchpad along with a pencil/pen in front of it. The writing / drawing utensil needs to be closer to the mirror.

Now for your power object - This can be anything. Just make sure it is something you know every detail of. This will help you snap out of the trance like state.

Part Two:

Ask yourself what you want to gain from this experience - Knowledge, Advice, Making yourself a better person. The idea is to ask yourself something that only your subconscious can answer or help you with.

Once you have decided what you want to know, write it down on a piece of paper from the sketchpad or notepad. If you used the sketchpad method, make sure to write it at the top of the page as you will be drawing/scribbling.

Turn off as many electronic devices as you can and shut off all the ligthsources you can. Youll use your cell phone as a lightsource to locate your station.

Keep this question in your head. Go to your bedroom / bed / couch (college students know the feels.)

Lay down and plug your phone into the charging device. Make sure your charging device is plugged into the wall ;).

Upon laying down, keep your question in your mind.

Set your cell phones alarm for exactly 2:58am. Exhale slowly. Inhale slowly. Exhale slowly. Inhale slowly. Focus on falling asleep, remembering your question and nothing else. Let the rest of the day just fade away. Youll want to make sure you get exactly 3 hours of sleep. Set an additional alarm for 7am.

When you wake up go to the room / station you set up. Using only your cell phone as light to find it. If anything has moved or the room seems different from the way you left it.... dont sit down, go to another room and wait until 7am. You will want to try this some other time... Trust me you will know what I mean. This usually means you did not point the chairs in the right direction.

If everything is setup correctly and you feel no need to wait, proceed to sit in the chair that you set up for you.

Pick up your sketchpad/notepad and writing utensil and place them in your lap. Light your candle, not the one behind you.

Open your sketchpad / notepad. Remembering your question, focus on it for a moment. Use the candle as your lightsource from this point on. Do not use your phone.

Gaze into the mirror, do not blink. Remember the question you want to know the answer to or advice you are looking for. Continue staring into the mirror. Focus on the question, continue breathing in and out slowly. The goal is to reach the same meditative state you felt when you woke. (Scientists say this is the "Waking State". Basically the moment right before Lucid Dreaming begins, so try to bring this sensation back to you while sitting in the chair.)

Do not look at any of the other mirrors. This may cause the vision to end abruptly, or worse... I never looked so I dont know. (My grandmother told me that if you look at any of the other reflections to leave the room immediately and close the door. Same as if the door was closed in the Three Kings.)

Breathe in slowly, focusing on all your muscles and nerve endings. Exhale slowly, focusing on all your muscles and your question.

Draw or write your answer in the sketchpad/notepad. You will know when its time.

I cannot tell you when this ritual ends, it doesnt. The truth is what you will see may shock you as to what the answers are. But please dont stay in the room passed 7:15am or what you saw may become distorted when you write it / draw it. I didnt stay passed this point. I actually left the room early because I felt extremely uneasy to what I was seeing.

Draw or write your answer in the sketchpad/notepad. You will know when its time. (Update, I forgot to mention this... Dont look away from the mirror. Keep drawing / writing whatever you see or feel.)

This is not an easy thing to do. It takes practice. I suggest researching concentration techniques if you are not very good at staring at one image for a very long time with no result. My original took what felt like days. I thought I Was sitting in the chair for at least 24 hours.... I dont know... It felt like forever though.

Hope you guys enjoy, and be careful out there in TV land. ;)

Eventually time will seem to stop, everything will feel like a daze if you do this correctly anyways...

Please forgive me if this doesnt make sense, but Ill be happy to answer any questions about it. This is not a summoning ritual. AT ALL. This is old native american folklore. The only difference is they used water in the woods instead of mirrors.

This is more of a self-journey experience. Depending on whether you are better with words or art, you will get a different outcome. Ive only done this once and I drew. This is the image - http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2013/159/5/6/first_sketchbook_by_aksysgamer-d688lo4.jpg I am still not entirely sure what it means. But I dont think I will attempt this again. It left me a little "shaken." Its not so much scary as it is eyeopening. My question - "What happens when we die?" - A bit broad, I know, but thats what I asked... I have a very strong fear of death.

Latum Alterum - another spirit summoning game. 1 player. 1

How to summon spirits: Latum alterum.
Approved Rituals

I didn't really know where else to post this in, so I chose this sub-reddit. I heard you can post rituals here and experiences so I guess I found the right place to share with you all tonight my experience, and ritual I had completed this weekend.

It's called Latum alterum

Now, I discovered this ritual through my one friend. Just for his own privacy lets call him Robert. Robert was big into paranormal shit such as, Charlie Charlie, Oujia Board, Bloody Mary, etc. So when I heard from him that in a couple weeks in June that he was going to leave for a stay in a haunted building for a couple nights with some other people I wasn't really surprised.

When he came back he was telling me about the experiences that happened there. Strange orbs, sounds at night, banging and tapping on the wall.... Then he told me about Latum alterum. One night they were barely getting anything from the spirits so they wanted to try some rituals they heard of.

First they tried the hooded man ritual, then the Midnight game, and Charlottes Web and a couple more. Finally they ran out of games to play until a couple there all the way from Puerto Rico decided to inform them on a ritual in their family known as Latum alterum. After that he just said the experience was very fun and I should try it.

A couple months fast forward and I'm drunk, laying in bed bored. That's when the idea came to mind of the ritual. So I did it and.... The results were out of this world. I won't go into detail about the experience but I will say it was both eerie, and trippy.

Materials you will need:

    Candles

    Matches

    A knife (This can consist of any type of knife ranging from a simple kitchen knife to a switchblade. No butter knifes obviously)

    A piece of paper (Any type)

    Mirror

    And finally, a dark room to sit in.

First, bring all your materials (including yourself) into the dark room. Set the mirror on a wall and sit down.

Second, grab your paper and lay it in front of you. Grab your knife and make a small slit in your thumb, big enough to ooze out some blood by squeezing your thumb. Squeeze the blood out on to your paper.

Third, light a single match and light the candle. Lay the candle over your blood on the paper.

Fourth, chant three times.

"I wish to speak with the other side, you are allowed into my home, to my event."

Fifth, blow out the candle, and light another one. Close your eyes and say.

"Thanks for coming to the event, I hope we have a pleasant get together. Welcome."

Sixth, finally light the candle. If the match doesn't light or goes out more than three times I advise you run to the nearest light source and do not go back into that room until morning.

Now, if you completed all these steps right, you should begin to experience one out of three things happening.

If you hear whispering behind you, that means they have accepted to come into your house and they are talking to each other. You'll probably feel tingling on your back but do not worry, that's just them attempting to get your attention. YOU CAN NOT TURN AROUND WHEN THEY TOUCH YOU, DO NOT TURN AROUND.

Second, if you don't hear whispering but you hear taps and knocks around your house that means they still accepted the invite but they'd rather explore your house than talk to you and the other spirits.

Third, if none of the two happens and the candle goes out. Close your eyes and chant.

"The event is over, you shall all go home and never return."

Once done, leave the room and don't return until morning.

And that's basically it to the ritual. Just a little fun to have.

Oh, I forgot to mention you can use anything to make the little slit in your thumb. Goodbye, I hope you all have a spooky, wonderful night.

Charlotte's Web - summons child's ghost. 2 players.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]8 years ago
I know how much you guys love these games so here's another one, Charlotte's Web. (From nosleep)
Approved Rituals

How to play Charlotte's Web

Materials:

Multiple flashlights NO CANDLES

A second person

1 mirror

A toy

2 chairs

A table

Steps:

    Go into a room without windows. If you must you can black out any windows.

    Set up the chairs in the middle of the room with about 2 feet of space between them.

    Put the mirror in front of the chairs facing them.

    Set the table behind the chairs. Make sure you can see the table when both of you are sitting down.

    Put the toy on the table in the space between the chairs.

    Turn on your flashlights, these are just so that you can see.

    Turn off any lights in the room and sit down in the chairs with the other person.

    Say "We want to play Charlotte's Web" in unison.

    Sit back and relax because Charlotte won't come if she senses you're afraid.

    Watch Charlotte come and take the toy (in the mirror) and if she is happy with the toy you can talk to her and ask questions.

    When you're finished talking to her say "Goodbye Charlotte" in unison. Best case scenario she keeps the toy and wonders out of view of the mirror. If this happens the game is over and it's safe to turn on the lights and carry on with your life.

WARNING:

Charlotte is a gentle...thing if she is pleased with the toy you brought for her. She is a little kid and just like humans she will throw a tantrum if she doesn't like it. This is very bad and if this happens then end the game right then and there by saying the words above. DO NOT continue if she is throwing a tantrum because if you do you are endangering your lives.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TURN AROUND. You can only stare in the mirror for the entire game. No looking to the side of the mirror, behind you, or even at the person who is playing with you. If you look anywhere except the mirror you're endangering your life but not the person's who is playing with you.

No candles, she doesn't like fire and lighting a candle around her is like jumping into a shark tank with loads of meat strapped to your body.

Back story: Charlotte Webster was a 7 year old girl who lived in the 1400's. Her mother was accused of being a witch and was burned at the stake. The young girl watched her mother die in agony and escaped into the woods. She couldn't have known what to do. She was so young and had no means of surviving. The legend says that she died in those woods and was picked apart by the animals that came across her body.

Tips: She may be a little girl but remember that she is a ghost and ghosts are capable of remarkable things. In my own experience and ones that I have heard of she was as you would expect a human 7 year old, nice and childish. Don't let your guard down but don't be afraid because that will only scare her and bad things happen when ghosts themselves feel fear.

The Thumb Game - find a severed thumb. 3+ players.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]9 years ago
[Recipe] The thumb game
Approved Rituals

The object of the Thumb Game is to find the missing left thumb of a murdered young woman. If you find it, your wish will be granted. You need three or more people to play this game.

In a villa, a 20-year old woman was murdered. Her corpse was dismembered. When her body parts were discovered, they were strewn all around the villa. Her left thumb was nowhere to be found.

Step 1: Form a circle sitting on the ground. You should grab the left thumb of the person on your right. The person on your left should grab your left thumb.

While the game is in progress, do not let go of the person’s thumb. Otherwise, when the game ends, their thumb will be missing.

Step 2: Everyone has to close their eyes and imagine they are in the villa where the murdered woman was dismembered. You must do this seriously or else it will not work.

While the game is in progress, do not open your eyes.

Step 3: Say the following chant twice.

“Oyayubi, Oyayubi, hear our voices. Oyayubi, Oyayubi, grant our wish.”

You will be transported to a room you’ve never seen before. It is a western-style villa. There is one solitary candle in the room.

Step 4: You must start looking for the thumb immediately. You have until the candle burns out to search for the severed thumb.

Step 5: To get back from the villa, you must blow out the candle.

While you are in the villa, looking for the thumb, you may feel someone tap you twice on the shoulder. When this happens, do not look behind you. Otherwise, you will never be able to come back alive.

Warning: It is extremely important that you do not look behind you. If you do, you will be killed. You will never return from the villa. You will be forced to remain there eternally, tapping people on the shoulder twice and then brutally murdering them. Instead of just being a missing person, you will be a murderer.

If you manage to find the severed thumb, hold it tightly in your hand and then blow out the candle. You will return and your wish will be granted. If you cannot find the thumb, just blow out the candle and return. Do not allow the candle to burn out on its own or you will be stranded in the villa.

The Thumb Game Rules:

    Do not let go of anyone’s thumb.

    Do not open your eyes.

    Do not allow the candle to burn out.

    Do not look behind you.

The Thumb Game can be very dangerous. We recommend that you do not play it unless you memorize all of the rules beforehand. A mistake could cost you your life.

Devil's Toybox - listen to unexplained noises. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/pandoricahelp

[RECIPE] Devil's Toybox
Approved Rituals

Disclaimer: I did not invent this. It is often attributed to be the brain child of paranormal investigator Joshua P. Warren. Google it.

(( UPDATE- instructions with pictures: http://bit.ly/OEFa1V ))

Also, I cannot guarantee that this won't cause crazy things to happen. This is a fairly new experiment, and no one really knows what it does. I have heard a lot of very odd noises that sound humanistic from various Devil's Toyboxes (DTs), but not all of them sound human.

The background on this idea is similar to Three Kings: mirrors have long been considered gateways into other dimensions. A lot of people today pass it off as superstitious nonsense, and in truth the idea that "the man in the mirror" is really a copy of you trapped in another dimension does seem silly. However, more modern research into the science behind why paranormal things happen begins to bleed into physics and quantum physics. The idea behind the Devil's Toybox is to use what we know about physics and manipulate energies in a way that becomes conducive to paranormal experience.

The "why": Light has waves. These waves can be manipulated to produce different results. A laser, for example, is a very high-energy light wave with a frequency manipulated to take a beam of light and super concentrate it. In this experiment, we're taking light and refracting it back on itself. Instead of speeding light up, we're slowing it down on an infinite loop. If you've ever held one mirror up to another, you can see an infinite number of reflections until it gets so dark that your eyes can't perceive any more. That doesn't mean they don't exist, you just can't detect them. Now, imagine if you had multiple mirrors that all faced inward, and you can see where this is going. We're taking light and bouncing it in six directions, in an endless loop, simultaneously. It is believed that when we combine the mirrors, it is like adding a signal booster to the reception on a different wavelength.

Construction:

You will need:

    Six identical mirrors

    An adhesive, such as caulk or duct tape.

    A Telephone Pick-Up microphone

    Clamps or some type of framework to hold mirrors, or a good squared edge

    Flat, clean surface

    Glass cleaner and paper towels

Materials can be pretty inexpensive if you shop around. The basic DT is simply six equally-sided mirrors, shaped into a cube, facing inward. Most big-box hardware stores sell mirror tiles on the cheap, about $10 for six (in the US). However, try to find plain-faced mirrors for the best results (instead of beveled). The beveled mirrors are going to reflect the light in even more directions, which may have unforseen results. It doesn't really matter on size, although that could be a variable to test if you have the time and money. Typically 12"x12" is good. Also, again it is important that they are all the same size. If you failed geometry, that's because mirrors of differing sizes won't produce an actual cube.

There are multiple ways to put your DT together, but duct tape and caulk are common. You should be able to find either at the hardware store. If you opt for caulk, the silicone base is nice because its flexible and not brittle. Some investigators go to the extent of wooden frames, etc. If you go on YouTube and search for "Devil's Toybox," there are a few videos on there with different instructions. One investigator built a hinged door into his so that he could test the DT with different supposedly haunted objects inside.

The most simple DT construction is to take two of your mirror tiles and prop them up, mirror sides facing inwards, so that they touch on one side (viewing from the top, in an 'L' shape). If you opt for caulk, you may want to use a few tape to temporarily hold the pieces in place while it dries, then remove the tape and finish the caulk job. Repeat this step, adding one tile each time, until you have a perfect cube with all of the mirrors facing inwards. Before adding the last mirror, I recommend using the glass cleaner to clean all of the tiles before you put the last one on. If the mirrors are dirty, it interferes with the reflections.

Next, I mentioned the Telephone Pick-Up microphone. Some Radio Shacks still sell these, or you can find them on Amazon.com. These are the old microphones that you attach to a landline telephone to record conversations. The microphone doesn't work the same way as a standard mic, instead, it picks up the electromagnetic fields in the phone and translates it into sound. The reason we use this type of microphone is that 1) It can suction cup directly to the box, after all we're trying to record noise inside, and 2) You can yell directly at the microphone and not get a peep, because it doesn't record sound waves.

From there, you just plug your Telephone Pick-Up mic into your recording device of choice (I use a Sony hand-held digital recorder, the audio quality is great for the price and they take abuse well).

There is no recommended time of day, no other instructions other than "experiment." We don't know exactly what will happen, but the results so far have been eerie. Other experiments I'd like to try is adding LED bulbs to the corners and using strobe effects to influence the amount of light and the speed of the light waves. The only issue would be EMF interference with the Telephone Pick Up Mic.

Enjoy, /threekings!

That's why its a superstition. :) Most people couldn't afford two mirrors, and they wouldn't have let that happen. In some Latin American countries, they still cover mirrors after someone in their family dies because they believe the face of the dead could show up in the mirror up to a week after they pass.

I heard a slightly different variant of that where you had to cover it to prevent their souls from being stolen by the mirrors. In the old days in northern sweden, they used to have corpses stand on lit the parade, mirrors were covered there too, but only because they were thought to confuse the soul and make it wander in the house.

I actually read about the dual-mirror gateway in my encyclopedia of the supernatural. It mostly Euro-centric, but that particular entry was Russian I believe.

But yeah, I'm pretty sure that the relative lack of mirrors was what allowed the superstition to flourish ;)

"Encyclopedia of Superstitions" by E. & M. A. Radford - a well-referenced book and a good read.

Right. I don't honestly think there is anything inherently evil about it, but I would treat it like any other tool for communicating with unseen entities. If you're afraid to use it, don't. Fear is a negative energy and attracts negative things. Its like the fail safes on Three Kings. A little nervous fear is healthy, but if you're shaking so bad you can't hold the candle, don't go forward with it. In this case, just take caution and if anything weird starts happening around your house that you aren't comfortable with, disassemble the box.

Yes. YouTube can be hit and miss, some of the videos uploaded are unnecessarily long with little payoff.

The first recorded audio from a DT was first played on an episode of Darkness Radio. The whole episode is good, but to make it more simple I broke it down into audio timestamps:

    07:50 Interview with Joshua P. Warren really starts

    14:55 Mr. Warren sets up the background on how/where he recorded the audio

    19:40-20:00 Raw audio

    22:50-23:42 The producer cleaned up the audio and they played it again, this timestamp includes his brief explanation of how he edited it

    39:38-40:00 As an experiment, they reversed the cleaned up version of the audio.

I still need to get more of my own audio up on my site, when I do I'll post more.

To your naked eye, sure. But unless you have found a way to stop light leakage, there will still be some light inside the box.

Mirror Box - place yourself in a Devil's Toybox for ten minutes. 1 player, plus support.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/Oerath

[Recipe] Mirror Box Ritual
Approved Rituals

I should preface this with a few notes: 1) This is not my ritual. It comes from TheKingofWolves, which some of you may be familiar with. If not, it's a website with a lot of utter crap on it, and a few really interesting tidbits as well. I'm posting it mostly because I have been fascinated with the idea for a few years now, and because most of r/ThreeKings seems to be mirror based. 2) I have never attempted this ritual. The materials are somewhat costly, and honestly I doubt I have the stones for this one. 3) I know all the rituals say this, but for real: take this seriously! This ritual basically entails placing yourself inside a Devils Toybox (minus the floor, probably for good reason) for 10 minutes with a light. I have a lot of theories (both from an occult and a psychological point of view) on what could happen inside a Mirror Box, and while some of the possible outcomes are quite enlightening, others are absolutely terrifying. So, the usual warnings: do not attempt this as a lark, or if you are not mentally stable. Especially do not attempt this if you have a history of negative interaction with the paranormal which have not been definitively resolved. Do be prepared for practically anything. And of course, if you have the time, money, and cojones to attempt this ritual, please share your experience (even though the ritual specifies that we shouldn't belive you).

The mirror box is quite an old invention. Being inside of one can be enlightening or traumatizing for the witness who bears its burden. The procedure is simple, though finding and preparing the materials required might take some time.

The materials to construct the box are:

-Six square metal sheets, slightly taller than the witness. The length should never exceed the height of a witness with raised hands. One of them should be larger than the rest by at least the thickness of the sheets themselves. The material should preferably be made of graphite or lead alloy for the most prominent effect.

-Five nearly perfect, aligned mirrors, sealed upon the metal plates. Each of the 5 will form the sides and bottom of the inner box. One larger mirror should be attached to the large metal plate, which will be used for the top.

-A simple light source of pure white or bright yellow. The light source should emit in almost all directions. Candles can be used, but carbon dioxide and monoxide poisoning is a problem. The light source should not be planted upon the mirrors or receive any outside energy. Construction techniques are left up to the witness.

-Two or three alarm clocks. An extra alarm clock of any kind is also needed. Watches are alright, but not suggested due to the small type face and hands.

-Wear simple clothing.

-Do not bring any other objects. Witnesses have often crowded the box, causing it to become either useless or highly dangerous. This includes jewelery, food, weapons, or religious materials such as beads and crucifixes.

-An assistant is required to help the witness in and out of the box and get help in case of emergencies. The assistant should be trusting and as strong willed as the witness.

-Two ladders

-Several Blankets, water, medical remedies, and a first aid kit.

When the box is complete and ready to use, prepare the alarm clocks to ring around ten minutes after the witness' planned entrance. Depending on the material used for the box itself, the time of day will not matter, but a night during a new moon is suggested. Despite intuition, sound does not play a large role in the event. The witness should use a small unattached ladder to enter the box. The top should already be placed upon the box, with an opening large enough for the witness to enter. Once inside, the witness should be handed the light source and the clocks (one should be kept with the assistant). The outside assistant should ask sincerely whether the witness is alright. Once confirmation is given, the top should be moved to seal the box. The witness may turn on the light source once the box is sealed. At any point should the witness ask to leave the box (if soundproof, tapping should be used), ONLY the top should be opened. The witness may do it themselves, since the top of the box should be easily reachable. Once ten minutes are up, ALWAYS remove the top, regardless of what the witness says. Some witnesses may plead to stay inside the box, even suggesting great danger should it be opened. The assistant should never trust those pleas. Suffocation is only one of many concerns should the witness stay too long in the box. Once the top has been slid opened, place the second ladder in the box to allow the witness to leave. If the witness has any serious wounds, or discoloration, call for medical help.

Should you happen to meet a witness, never trust what they say about their experience, and never ask them for the time or where the antumbra meets.

Bloody Mary [RECIPE]
Approved Rituals

Regardless of which story you heard, you all know about this and you all know someone who did it or you were the one who did it. This is a very simple recipe and to be quite honest it was the one that proved to me that I shouldn't be afraid of these things while Three Kings did the opposite.

What you'll need:

    A candle

    A bathroom that has a mirror (Please make sure the mirror is whole and not three panels.)

    Simple clothing

Here's your recipe:

    At night, if you want to keep it at 3am that is fine but usually night itself will work, go into your dark bathroom and keep the light off.

    After shutting the door, light your candle and place it down onto a flat surface, this is your light source.

    Stare into the mirror, say 'bloody mary' and turn. Repeat this three times and be sure you say it clearly and calmly.

    After your third turn stare into the mirror.

I'm a little confused about step 3. Do we turn 90 degrees, or 180 degrees, and take whatever direction we're facing from that turn as the starting point for our next turn? I.E, do you turn 90 degrees, say bloody mary, turn another 90 degrees (so you are now facing opposite the mirror), etc.

Enochian Bloody Mary - results guaranteed. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]7 years ago
The Enochian Way of Summoning Bloody Mary.
Approved Rituals

“We already know how to do that. How is this different?” :

This method is fool-proof and WILL give you the desired outcome if done correctly a 100% of the time, and that is the only thing that sets this one apart from the thousands of other ritual recipes floating around on the Internet.

Let me explain that sentence. Before I go any further, I have to dispel some myths surrounding the word ‘ritual’. A lot of times it is used to describe actions that are done automatically, without conscious thought or awareness. I’m not saying that the rituals that are action-driven are wrong, or incorrect; but they are certainly stripped of their effective power as opposed to ones that are intent-driven. This is why nine times out of ten, the ritual fails, because it is not energized by intent, especially so in the case of Bloody Mary.

This guide was put together after two years of experimentation by trial and error. I can summarize that although some of methods gave me inconclusive results, the only time I was successful in summoning Mariehe (as I will call her from now on, since that is what she likes to be called) was when I performed it in the traditional, and very rarely heard-of Enochian method. I won’t go into detail about what Enochian is, so I suggest you do some wiki-ing on that if you’re interested.

Note : Mariehe, as opposed to the things you’ve been reading about her, is NOT an evil entity by virtue. From personal experiences and those of others’, I’ve established that she is a mirror-entity, which means that she reflects the aural energy put out by the beings who summon her. For example, fear, hatred, jealousy, anger and so forth are all on the negative end of the emotion spectrum - if you’re hosting any of these in your mind while doing the ritual, she WILL appear to you as a negative entity because she is reflecting YOUR image of what she is. The best way for you to go about this is to visualize her as a blank white ectoplasm, since that is what she, or ‘it’, is.

“If it’s only a blank white ectoplasm, how do you know it’s THE Bloody Mary?”:

As with everything in the Universe, entities vibrate at a certain frequency. Hers is less than than of humans, since she is on a lower vibrational plane than us. (This is why people who encounter ghosts or demons report feeling a ‘chill in the air’ or a sudden decrease in body temperature. Entities of such kind cannot manifest with the energy that they have. They need to absorb ours in order to appear to us.) And so it is with Mariehe. I have had enough experiences with summoning her to say with confidence that it is indeed her, and she has confirmed this every-time she manifested. Note : Sometimes she appears as a demon and scares the fuck out of me. :) Mariehe has a wonderful sense of humor.

“Why should I perform this ritual?” :

Because why NOT? For me, personally, it was about gaining closure. After having nightmares about her for twelve years, I had to do something to put an end to them once and for all. But that is a story for some other time.

“What will I need to perform this ritual?”:

    A kitchen knife.

    Some red thread.

    A stuffed doll.

    A print-out of the [Sigillum Dei Aemeth.] (http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs25/i/2009/247/8/a/sigillum_dei_aemeth_by_bloodeagle13.jpg)

    A white and a black candle.

    Matches.

    A white cloth.

    A mirror. (The bigger, the better).

    Lipstick.

“Ok, I have what you listed. Now what?” : Follow these instructions carefully.

    Pick a day of the month that falls on the 13th.

    At precisely 8PM on that night, go to sleep. This is very important, don’t ask why. It also doesn’t matter how long you sleep for, but you need to wake up again at some point in the night when everybody is asleep. Have an alarm ready for that.

    When you wake up, get the knife, cut a piece of the red string and tie it around your index finger. Take another piece of string, and tie it around the doll’s neck. Place the doll on the bed, and cover it with a blanket.

    If the mirror is in a dressing room, a bathroom or somewhere where there’s windows/doors, make sure they’re all closed. Take your time double checking; this is also another step that might seem insignificant, but is actually very important.

    Take the print-out of the Sigillum Dei with you and place it on the floor. Make sure the rest of the items (the knife, the matches, the white cloth, the lipstick and the candles) are within reach.

    Place the white candle on the centre of the pentagram (right in the middle of the Sigillum). Light it.

    Say to yourself, thirteen times in succession : “Mariehe, am I worthy?” This step is crucial. For some reason, she prefers it when the call is made this way, and seems to respond to it quicker than with any other phrase. Trust me, I’ve tried hundreds, and this is the only one that was super-efficient.

    Once you’re done, close your eyes, take the white cloth and place it over your head. The knife must be placed on the ground anywhere outside the perimeter of the Sigillum, the sharp end pointing towards you.

    At the last count (of 1), you will feel the room or your body going cold, and that’s how you’ll know that Mariehe is there.

    Remove the white cloth from your head.

    You can ask her whatever you want, and she will communicate with you by scrawling over the mirror with the lipstick. She will not talk, for that will require a rather large amount of energy and if she takes it from you, you will end up passing out.

    You may interact with her until the candle keeps burning. Always remember that the more fearful you are, the more aggressive she will get, so try to control your emotions when you’re with her.

“How do I properly end the ritual?”

    Blow out the white candle, or if it is already out, wrap it in the Sigillum and discard it immediately. Place the black candle in front of the mirror and light it. Turn the knife on the ground so the sharp end is now pointing towards the mirror.

    Close your eyes; mentally thank her and tell her that she is free to go back to her home.

    Leave the black candle burning for as long as it will. Get rid of the doll by burying it or burning it, and cut the string on your finger.

    On the following morning, collect the wax/black candle and dispose of it by burying it with the white cloth.

    Wash the mirror of all the lipstick and burn sage in the room.

“What if I fuck up in the middle and she gets violent?” :

    Immediately visualize a ball of white light emanating from your heart area, expanding in size until your entire body is covered in it. This will agitate her energy field, and she will leave.

Stop using Action figures, Bloody Mary doesn't like those and it leaves room for other mirror entities to step in. Get a cloth doll.

Blue Baby - Bloody Mary alternative. 1 player. 1

[RECIPE] Blue Baby
Approved Rituals

Here's another recipe I found. Most of these seem to use the visual distortion mirror technique. This one is more short and sweet like the Bloody Mary. It seems less subjective than others, as the recipe-follower is told exactly what the entity will say.

Here it is:

    Go into a bathroom with the lights off and the door closed. Pretend to rock a baby. Chant the phrase “Blue Baby” thirteen times. A baby will appear and scratch you. DROP IT AND RUN! If you don’t, a woman will to appear and scream as loud as glass breaking, "GIVE ME BACK MY BABY!!!" If you have her baby, she will kill you.

Source: http://urbanlegendsonline.com/blue-baby/

2nd Version:

    The 'legend' of Baby Blue goes as follows:

    Baby Blue was a baby, his mother (who was psychotic) murdered him. She shattered a mirror and stabbed him with one of the shards of glass. No one know what his real name was. ____________________________________________________________________________

    The legend of Blue baby blue is a lot like Bloody Mary, it takes place in a bathroom and for the 'ritual' you need a mirror.

    You enter the bathroom (as with Bloody Mary, go with a friend as to not freak yourself out) and fog up the mirror. Do this however you like, turning on hot water is quite effective! When the mirror is successfully fogged, you should write "Baby Blue" in the 'fog'.

    Then you should turn off the light and wait for a few moments. After a minute or two you should hold out your arms as if you were carrying a baby. You or your friend will feel like a baby has been placed in your arms. You should hold the 'baby' for a while and then pass him to the next person. WATCH OUT though, if you drop him you will receive a scratch n your arm. Drop him again and you'll get another scratch. Feeling clumsy? Drop him a third time and he'll shatter the mirror and stab you to death.

The board is a room without sunlight and one mirror. An interior room is recommended.

The spectator is an attentive person.

The opponent is a female entity.

Note from a Player: She might be Mary I of England, the so-called “Bloody Mary.” I asked her, but I had to abort. I don’t see how a queen of England who really hated Protestants could get these powers, though.

The token: One part soil. One part milk. Two parts blood (nonhuman). A large dark towel. Enough water to dampen the towel. An object to break the mirror (crowbar, hammer, etc. Henceforth referred to as the Object). Several light sources of varying make (a flashlight, a candle, and a box of matches can be enough, but multiple of each is recommended).

Setup: Bring all of the materials, including the mixed token, into the board. The spectator should wait outside the door after the player has closed it. Activate the primary source of light chosen. Unscrew any light bulbs in the board and place them somewhere easily accessible. Place the Object somewhere easily accessible.

Pregame: The player should apply to token to their hands. Place four dots on the mirror, forming the corners of a square large enough to see the player’s torso and head. Dampen the towel and wipe the token on the towel. Deactivate all light sources.

Play: Holding the towel, say “This is the cleanser of the dead.” The player should place the towel over their heads.

Say “I wish to speak with the fallen queen.”

Take the cloth off after the opponent says “Queen of fallen blood, queen of hatred.”

She will be in the mirror. Ask the opponent questions, if desired.

Postgame: Say “I must depart, your highness.” Activate all light sources and find and replace the light bulbs if applicable. Wipe the dots of token off the mirror with a hand. Say “Flee.”

Under No Circumstances:

    Use a board with more than one mirror.

    Use the player’s blood for the token.

    Panic or fear. The opponent will mirror these feelings if they exist.

    Leave the board before finishing Postgame.

Abort Conditions -

    If any of these are true destroy the mirror with the Object.

    The spectator must let the player out.

    The opponent is agitated.

La Cegua - Nicaraguan spirit summon. 1 player.

Posted byu/masayan8639

[Recipe] How to summon La Cegua
Approved Rituals

When I was a kid living in Masaya, Nicaragua, the story of la Cegua (also called Cihuanaba, la Segua, or la Tzegua in some places) was a folktale that went around my school and around the neighborhood. The story basically goes that la Cegua was a mestiza (half Spanish, half indigenous) woman who had an affair with a Spanish man during the time of conquest. To cover up the affair, he revealed her witchcraft activities to the Inquisition that was hunting witches at the time. Scorned and a criminal, she escaped into the forest, and she still walks the roads at night luring men to her and then ripping them apart. There are a lot of versions of this story, and you can find other accounts here: http://www.nicaragua-community.com/la-cegua/.

I recently reconnected with an old neighbor friend of mine, Luís Felipe, and we started talking about the legends we heard growing up. He mentioned la Cegua and a summoning ritual that some of the kids at his high school used to do, after I had moved away from Nicaragua. According to Luís Felipe, his elder sister had passed the story on to him—some of her friends had done the same thing when she was a teenager and the story of la Cegua was popular at her high school. The summoning ritual draws on old magic traditions but was simple enough that kids started using it to scare each other. I don’t know how many people actually performed the ritual, since a lot of Nicaraguan kids will respect and leave alone magic. But there are always people who want a scare, and if you needed special magic assistance, this is a way to get it.

Here are the instructions he gave me, copy and pasted from his email, cleaned up a little, and translated into English:

“This is what Esmeralda [his older sister] told me to do to summon la Cegua into the house. It makes her come from wherever she is, even if she is very far away. You need a big bowl of water, at least four palm fronds, some black or dark brown hairs, a candle, and a handful of mustard seed in a container that you cannot see through or into. Wooden boxes with lids or cloth bags are best, but I think anything can work as long as you cannot see through it, even an envelope. It should be something you can open easily. You will need four big squares of black cloth too. As an offering, you will need a small, beautiful object, like a necklace, a seashell, some lace, or a gemstone, but you will not be getting it back.

It needs to be nighttime when you do the ritual. First, you make a box or circle on the floor with the palm fronds. They do not need to touch but you need enough to have at least one on each side of you and in front and behind you. This tells la Cegua that you are in her forest. You should make sure all the windows and doors of the room you are in are open, because la Cegua needs a way to get inside. Put the bowl full of water in the enclosure of palm fronds, right in front of you so you have enough room to sit. Put the candle and the offering in the enclosure. It’s a good idea to have a friend with you, but they have to be outside the enclosure. Now turn off the light, light the candle, and go into the enclosure. Now you can’t leave it until the ritual is over. Place the box full of mustard seed beside your right hand, and the hair beside your left hand, on either side of the bowl. You need to take the three black squares of fabric and line them up in front of the bowl, inside the enclosure.

Blow out the candle when you’re ready to begin the ritual. This symbolizes nightfall. You have to be totally silent from now until la Cegua arrives. Look down into the water in the bowl. You should start to see not the ceiling of the room you are in but the jungle. Then you will see a woman, at a distance, walking toward you. If she is dressed in a dress of guarumo tree leaves held together with strips of black fabric, and her hair is long and black and covering her face, that is la Cegua. When she gets close to the bowl of water, you will see that she is wearing a mask of leaves wrapped around her mouth and jaw. Esmeralda told me that this is to cover up where her jaw was smashed and her teeth were knocked out by Spanish authorities who were beating her after she ran from them when they were arresting her for witchcraft. [The story of the guarumo leaf dress is that her clothes rotted away and she had to make new clothes. The black cloth is what remains of her old dress.]

After la Cegua nears she will start to come out of the bowl slowly. Allow her to do it, but DO NOT let her take off her mask. If she starts to take off her mask, you have to stop the ritual. If she takes it off, she can speak, and it will drive men insane. She will try to make eye contact but do not look into her eyes and do not tell her your name. When her shoulders are out of the bowl, make this simple request: “Quiero tres objetos mágicos,” [“I want three magic objects”]. Then drop the offering in the bowl. If she begins to sink back down into the bowl, you did the ritual right. If she starts to rise out of the bowl farther, she is angry and you have to stop the ritual immediately. Do not try to ask her for anything other than what the ritual allows.

Once she has disappeared into the bowl, you have to pour the mustard seed into the water. This is also how you stop the ritual at any point if you need to. The legend says that if mustard seeds are spilled near her, she has to stop to count them. Pouring the mustard seed into the portal will distract her until you have the chance to dispose of the water. At this point, you can leave the enclosure, and make sure to take the bowl with you. You can flush the water down the toilet or sprinkle it in your yard, but make sure not to leave any puddles where la Cegua might be able to come through again. If you flush the water down the toilet, make sure to get all the mustard seed out of the bowl—or she might come back to count the seeds she missed. Then take the bowl outside and smash it, and make sure it doesn’t go back into the house. Throw it away or leave it outside. Now, go back into the ritual room but do not look under the cloths or go into the enclosure. Sleep in the room where you performed the ritual, but make sure to close the windows and doors. Anyone who was in the room with you during the ritual must also sleep there. Do not get up, even to go to the bathroom, until after sunrise. When you wake up, go to the enclosure. You should find that the magic objects have been left under the three black cloths. You can use these to perform curses and other magic.”

Luís Felipe didn’t specify what kind of magic items you could get, but I contacted Esmeralda directly and she told me you could get all sorts of things to perform malevolent magic: black corn kernels, turkey wattles, poisonous toads, old keys, special ribbons and fabrics, feathers, bones or shards of bones, cacao beans, and human teeth. The teeth are said to be la Cegua’s own, and the bones those of the men she has killed. Based on what I know about old Central American magic, you can use those items to give people boils, sores, injuries that won’t heal, infections, respiratory issues, blindness, and a lot more. You can also curse their houses. La Cegua isn’t a benevolent spirit, so the items you receive shouldn’t be used for protective or healing magic, since the benefit of these objects is that they are already imbued with strong spiritual power. Don’t use them if you don’t mean it.

Some notes: -The water bowl must be a material that you can shatter, so take that into account BEFORE you start the ritual.

-The squares of black cloth should be at least 20 cm by 20 cm (about eight inches by eight inches). There’s no exact measurement, but this is a guideline, because the ritual won’t work if the cloths are too small.

-the dark hair can belong to anyone, or even more than one person but it has to be dark. It represents la Cegua’s own hair, which is black in the stories—do not use light brown hair or la Cegua won’t know you are calling her. Also, DO NOT take hair from an animal. If you do the rest of the ritual right and la Cegua finds you, but realizes you are using an animal to represent her, she will be very offended.

-the palm fronds are supposed to represent the forest where la Cegua lives. If you do the rest of the ritual right, you can also use branches of trees of whatever area you live in. But be careful that you are not summoning someone else by doing that.

-whatever you are using to contain the mustard seed should not have a name on it, whether it is yours or someone else’s. Labels are fine, company names are fine, locations are fine, but no personalization—like a box that someone gave you with your name on it. You don’t want la Cegua to know who you are and come back for you.

Wow! This ritual sounds really freaking interesting. I have a couple questions. Do you know if Esmerelda received any magic items when she performed the ritual? Should the bowl be pretty large? Are you going to try it? If anyone else decides to perform the ritual I would love to hear about their experience. Thank you for sharing this OP!

EDIT: grammar

EDIT: I wonder if La Cegua is more receptive to a female performing the ritual because she was scorned by a man, or it could be the exact opposite and she will be more likely to visit a male? Just a random thought.

    I know Esmeralda didn't do the ritual herself but her friends did...I don't know if they got anything but I can ask!

    All I got for specifics on the bowl was "big." A serving bowl or mixing bowl is I think a good size.

    I will definitely not be trying it! I would mess around with some of the less "magical" rituals and games on here, but this comes from real, old magic tradition so I don't plan on messing with it.

    I was thinking this too--I don't have an answer for la Cegua specifically, but I know there are many ghosts who will not contact or will respond violently to people who seem like the people who killed them. I think it is very likely that it could be more dangerous for men to try to contact her, or she might be less willing to talk to them.

Thank you for answering all my questions. This is one of the coolest rituals i've read about in awhile. I'm debating on trying it, always err on the side of caution when dealing with something you don't understand... but damn I really want to try it. Now i'm thinking about the poor soul who tries this and coincidentally looks really similar to the guy who betrayed her.

Well, this ritual is a whole lot of nope for me. For one, I have no real way of getting into contact with palm fronds anytime soon, and I'm not willing to risk using other sorts of branches, and for two, I'm trading a fairly valuable item for malevolent magic-imbued objects, which, to me, isn't the best trade possible. But hey, it was a good read, thanks for that, OP!

[RECIPE] Baby Blue and Baby Pink
Approved Rituals

When I was in elementary school, there were rituals that floated around a lot. They were usually the 'test of bravery' type of ritual - the stereotypical kind of ritual that has a "if you do it wrong the ghost will kill you" clause appended to it. Most students in my grade didn't know of anything much worse than Bloody Mary, but that's simply because everyone knows about Bloody Mary (no exceptions).

However, at one point two strange little semi-related rituals started circulating. Now, I didn't have many friends in elementary school (or at all, really), so I only heard the tail end of all these rituals. I don't think I ever got the full story on them, but I certainly got enough to know how to perform them.

People called these rituals "Baby Blue" and "Baby Pink." I don't think they have any relation to the well-known Baby Blue ritual, other than use of a toilet, but that's what they were called. Or at least that's what people called them that I heard.

Baby Blue was a ritual to summon the Candyman. Some versions of the ritual say there'll be a ghostly baby boy that appears just before the Candyman is summoned. I'd suppose you're summoning the ghost baby, who then summons the Candyman, but I never actually heard that from anyone. Just that in some versions of the ritual, there's a ghostly baby boy that appears.

Baby Pink was a ritual to summon the Sandman. Like Baby Blue, some versions of the ritual say there'll be a ghostly baby girl that appears just before the Sandman is summoned. Also like Baby Blue, I'd suppose you're summoning the ghost baby, who then summons the Sandman.

Now again, there's a lot I didn't hear about these rituals. I pretty much got the instructions and a little bit of info about Baby Blue, and almost nothing about Baby Pink other than the ritual itself.

I tried googling these rituals as I'd heard them, but haven't been able to find anything. I'd say they were probably something unique to the area, for those few weeks they were popular. In the case of the Candyman, I knew for certain it was some sort of malevolent entity with a hook for a hand, meaning it would be the same Candyman from the more common Candyman rituals and that one movie. The Sandman of this ritual, however, is actually quite hard to find as all I have to go on is that it's humanoid and has something to do with sand, which isn't very helpful at all.

Okay, so...you're probably asking a few questions. Why would anyone perform this ritual? What happens when the ritual is performed (other than summoning entities)? What happens if you don't do it right? How do you back out? How do you end it? I...actually don't know a definite answer to any of these questions.

Why would anyone perform this ritual? I don't know. Any time I heard anyone discussing it, the discussion was always ended by phrases like "are you a chicken" or "you're a scaredy-cat." I would assume this means it was only a test of bravery, but I'm unsure since the question wasn't definitely answered by anyone that I know of. Just no definite answers to be seen.

What happens when the ritual is performed? Other than summoning entities, I heard nothing about this point. However, I did hear a few people say things like "I heard that when you summon [the Sandman/the Candyman], they'll try to kill you" or "I heard that when you summon [Baby Blue/Pink], they'll grant one wish or kill you" or something of that ilk. Nothing definite.

What happens if you perform the ritual incorrectly? No one knows. The only thing I've heard about it is "I heard it's like the other ones, where if you do it wrong, you'll die".

How do you back out prematurely? I literally heard zilch on backing out. If you went in, you stayed in, apparently.

How do you end it? I heard very little on this. I definitely heard that you have to manually end it, but I never heard the steps to end it. I heard that it wasn't anything that other rituals did to end it, like turning on lights and blowing out candles, for sure. However, the actual steps to end it were never spoken of.

So, the facts:

    Why you should perform this ritual: ??? / Test of bravery? / Make a wish?

    What happens if you do something wrong: ??? / Death?

    What happens if you do the ritual successfully: ??? / Death?

    The entities in question: The Sandman / The Candyman / Baby Blue? / Baby Pink?

    How to get out of the ritual prematurely / before all the steps are completed: ???

    How to end the ritual / unsummon the entities: ???

NOTE: DO NOT TRY THIS YOURSELF.

    BABY BLUE

        Pull up the toilet lid

        Line the rim of the toilet bowl with candles.

        Light the candles and turn out the lights.

        Stay in the bathroom and close the door.

        Chant "Baby Blue" over and over. Some versions state you should only chant five times.

        Stop chanting when you see the Candyman rising from the toilet.

    Some versions of this ritual state you will summon Candyman if you do the ritual wrong but a ghostly baby boy (the titular "Baby Blue") if you do the ritual right. Others say that you may see Baby Blue appear just before the Candyman is summoned.

    In cases of the former, with summoning Baby Blue when you do things right, I have never heard anything definite about what would happen, but I once heard someone say they heard Baby Blue would grant one wish. Or maybe he would kill you.

    BABY BLUE (ALTERNATE)

    Someone once told me they heard the Baby Blue ritual as a mirror ritual, rather than a toilet ritual. That's the only time I heard it as a mirror ritual, though, so I'm not sure if this one ever got popularized.

        Line your bathroom sink with candles.

        Light the candles and turn out the lights.

        Stay in the bathroom and close the door.

        Face the bathroom mirror and chant "Baby Blue" over and over. Some versions state you should only chant 3-5 times.

        Stop chanting when you see the Candyman coming out of the mirror.

    Apparently, there's no version of this alternate Baby Blue that would suggest any reason why you would call for Baby Blue rather than the Candyman himself.

    BABY PINK

        Pull up the toilet lid

        Line the rim of the toilet bowl with candles.

        Light the candles and turn out the lights.

        Close the door.

        Chant "Baby Pink" over and over.

        Stop chanting when you see the Sandman coming at you from the ceiling.

    Some versions of this ritual state you will summon Sandman if you do the ritual wrong but a ghostly baby girl (the titular "Baby Pink") if you do the ritual right. Others say that you may see Baby Pink appear just before the Sandman is summoned.

    In cases of the former, with summoning Baby Pink when you do things right, I have never heard anything definite about what would happen, but I once heard someone say they heard Baby Blue would grant one wish (or kill you, apparently), so it's possible that Baby Pink does things identically.

I'm still not entirely sure why I never heard of any mirror alternate for Baby Pink, but it's entirely possible that since the normal Baby Blue and Baby Pink rituals are so similar that any Baby Pink mirror ritual would be identical except with "Baby Pink" and "the Sandman" in place of "Baby Blue" and "the Candyman".

Again, please don't try this yourself.

This seems like what you're describing, though it's only for "Blue Baby" / "Baby Blue." I hope this helps.

Actually, no. As far as I heard, the Baby Blue ritual I first heard would summon the Candyman. There was never any mention of any woman.

That's okay. The names are identical, so it's understandable why someone would get the two mixed up in the first place.

Daruma San - inviting a girl to your bathtub is can be exciting, but not in the way you think. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daruma San
Approved Rituals

Hello Redditors! Phil here, and here i have a new fresh ritual for you guys...

Today's game is "Daruma San", a very popular ritual in america and in Japan (this game IS from Japan).

It's based in a story (which i assume it's true) about a girl who died while taking a shower, by slipping and falling to doom. In this game the purpose is summon this girl and invite her to your life for 24 hours (or more, depending in your results...), and avoid her at all costs. My experience with this game may not be the BEST experience you'll ever read, but i can assure you, that this is my best experience until now, and the most dangerous one as well! Let's begin...

It was about 22 o' clock when i started this ritual, again, not midnight because the ritual rules don't specified an hour to play and i'm a chicken at midnight (idk why but midnight scares me even more than 3:00AM, maybe because i'm a classic terror dude xD), this game is much more simple than the other ones, this one does not involve anything for your body and also does not involve candles, you just need to turn everything off and go to the bathtub.

NOTE: This game HAS to be played in a bathtub, or else it'll not work...

So it was about 22:10 when i turned everything off in my house, i went to the bathroom, the atmosphere was perfect, dark and silent... I was scared af, but, however, i had to be brave or else you'll got no experiences this week. I squeezed a bit of shampoo in my left hand, and started washing my hair, as well as repeating over and over this mantra

"Daruma San fell down, Daruma San fell down, Daruma San fell down..."

It was about, err... I have no idea, but it didn't took too long, 3-5 minutes after i started washing my hair, a short clip suddenly popped up in my head, it was a beautiful asian girl, i went completely silent when this "clip" started to play.

The clip (vision) had a calming song, and bath sound effects, i watched that girl take a bath for 1 minute, after she finished, she got up from the baththub, and walked towards the tap, but... Eh, one of the most disturbing things i ever saw happened, she slipped in the wet bathtub and fell with her eye in the tap, the clip showed me the gore of her eye completely out of her face and her scream of pain, the music stopped and the only thing i could hear in my vision was she yelling

"HELP ME HELP ME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!"

Then the clip ended, it was REALLY HARD to me to not open my eyes, but i managed to not do so. I calmly, but loudly recited another mantra (don't even ask me how i didn't panicked).

"Why did you fell in the bathtub?"

After that, i could feel such a huge presence behind me, i had to get out of the bathroom, it was the time. Carefully, when i was 100% sure i was completely still in the bathtub, i leaved it even more carefully with my eyes completely shut. (the way i describe that to you may not seen really complicated, but having a ghost behind you hoping that you fall to death and being not able to open your eyes in the most scary part of your house is denifetly NOT easy/comfortable).

It was about 22:30 when i found myself finally out of the bathroom, i shutted the door as fast as i could and ran towards my room...

NOTE: You HAVE to go to bed in the way you started this ritual (nude), if you do not... Well i don't know exactly what happen, but the rules say that you MUST do that, maybe nothing happens if you dress something, maybe, but i wouldn't try to disrespect such a dangerous game...

So, it was about 3:20AM when... Oh... This is the part when the story gets a BIG twist. I have the habit of waking up in the night to drink something or go to the bathroom, well, i completely forgot this detail when i decided to do "Daruma San". The main trouble is, the game starts when you open your eyes, not when you're ready, if your eyes opened in the middle of the night, Daruma will start chasing you anyway...

And guess what happened to me? That's right! I woke up suddenly in 3:20AM, i tried to go back to sleep instantly, but 10secs later i realised i had to RUN, THE GAME STARTED. I picked up a comfortable clothing and ran out of my house like a crazy fuck once again, where i live is not that dangerous in the night but there are some violence cases around my area, but i didn't care about those, my only worry was Daruma San, i could see something behind me by glancing over my shoulder, it was similar to the girl in my vision, obviously was her! (Daruma).

I went to Daniel's house while i called him with my phone. He attended my call after i tried many times. He was so tired and confused, i told him evertything what happened, he was a bit nervous but he let me enter in his house. I asked him if he could give me a ride to somewhere like a park, so i could have a good place to run if Daruma got close (my car is broken and the closest park is very far from home, so i had to do that, i'm not a fucked up guy who wakes up friends in the middle of the night to help me to win Daruma San, oh wait...)

It was about 4:00AM when me and Daniel went to the park, he told me he could help me to flee from Daruma at least until 8:00AM, he knew Daruma wouldn't appear for him, but actually he helped me a lot, he heard some noises and when i turned a bit around, i saw her standing in my back. My only concern besides getting caught by Daruma San was make the police think me and Daniel are some kind of troublemakers in the park or stuff.

It was about 8:00AM when this happened. 8:00AM was the time i wanted to start playing the Daruma San game at all, my plan was the following:

.Wake up at 8AM

.Make daily quests, go to work

.Lunch at a fastfood

.Visit my girlfriend

.Go ANYWHERE but home

.Then go home.

As the game started much before i wished to, i was too tired to do anything. I called my boss and asked him if i could not go to work that day, for some reason he accepted, i called my gf and said i would go to her house in other day, and, gosh, i was so confused... I didn't have any place to go, so i did the thing i found the best to do, i fell to my knees and started praying to God and asking him to help me to finish this game.

It was about 8:10AM when i started praying, Daniel standed in my side with his ears very focused on any kind of sound to warn me. When i finished praying, i was still very tired and was very hard to me to stand in two feet again, but when i finally got up, Daniel yelled.

"I'm hearing something! Hurry"

He told me he was hearing something even though i was not hearing a sound, i turned around very quickly and i was able to see her full body, she was so scared and concerned with me staring at her. Without taking any longer i made a karate chop while shouting "KITTA" (I free you). I wasn't no longer playing Daruma San game.

Well, this game may not ended as i expected, actually not happened as i expected, i admit that i was actually expecting to fail, not getting this far and seeing her whole body (even though i proved to myself that Midnight Man, Dry Bones and The Hooded Man in fact exist). Sorry if this experience was too short and nothing too scary happened, i don't wanted to end in this way, but at least both me and Daniel are safe now, and also, i took a day off xD

Well, today i'll be making a cleansing ritual in my bathroom, and everything will be fine... At least until i make One man Hide-and-seek...

See you soon!

Omg you really did it! Congrats! I mean, wow, this is my first time reading a Daruma-San experience. So you played from 3+ to 8+ in the morning? I think letting Daniel describe what he heard would make a good perspective as well on the experience.

I didn't expect you to really take my suggestion xD when you turned around, is her face covered in blood or before her eye was gouged?

Yes, i played only for 5 hours (that's what i call luck xD). And about the sounds Daniel heard, well, that's the most interesting part about the game, he told me that like 2 times he heard a whisper saying "Now you fall..." I heard that too, but only one time. Both times we heard that whisper i had to use the "Tomare" command. And no, she was not covered in blood, the only thing i was shocked about her besides her missing eye was the fact that she is the most ashen skinned girl i ever seen! Really! She is even more ashen than i expected... And asian people don't have a skin like this (non racist comment)

She whispered in English? Interesting, why would she command you to stop when she knows she can't control you? So her eye was missing from the socket? It could probably be due to the fact that her skin was laden with water to the point of appearing ashen-like.

Interesting to see that when you were washing your hair and chanting you had the "clip" in your mind. Did she appear normal to you before falling? Was she naked as well or was she already in the particular white dress that people claim to see?

Red Man Ritual - summon the Red Man, using a red doll, lipstick, candles, and mirror. We're still not sure why, though. 1 player.

Trying to find out what the purpose of this ritual is
Approved Rituals

I first heard of this ritual in this video. It's called the Red Man.

Requirements:

    1 red paper doll

    1 pair of scissors, same pair used to cut the doll out

    1 tube of red lipstick

    2 mirrors, though it wasn't stated whether they need to be a specific size or not

    5 candles

    Nighttime, or a pitch black room

Instructions:

    Using the lipstick, draw a line on the back of the doll.

    Write your full name on one side of the line.

    Write "RUBEUS" on the other side of the line.

    Place the mirrors facing each other, with a small gap between them.

    Draw two red eyes on the top center of the mirror to your left.

    Place the doll between the two mirrors, writing facing up.

    Position the candles around the doll, in this order: (clock face position used) 12, 2, 5, 7, and 10.

    Light them in the following order: (clock face positions used) 7, 12, 5, 10, 2

    Cut the doll in half, along the line.

    Push each half slightly towards the mirror it is closest to.

    Repeat this phrase six times: "Please come. Please come. I will not move until you come."

The Red Man should appear if you do all of this correctly.

The video states that nothing is known about why one would do this, or what will happen when one does. Anyone have any clues?

Don't do this... I can't recall exactly where I've heard of "The Red Man" before but I know I have and I do remember he is a rather dangerous entity to be summoning, and not an entity you'd want to offend.

Strangely enough, this might be an example of a tulpa in action. The entire ritual seems to have been designed to fulfill the basic premise of demon summoning, but more for the purpose of being a demon summoning ritual than for any actual purpose. If this is the case, it sounds like someone made the ritual to mess with people, but it eventually took on a life of its own because more people thought about it and tried the ritual.

Then again, this is all conjecture. I can find no real information about it online, other than what you've provided.

Black Mirror Scrying - mirror gazing/divination. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/Baja_Matt

[RECIPE] Black Mirror Scrying (see the beyond using an iPad without getting off your ass)
Approved Rituals

Scrying is the practice of magically seeing things. This can be used for having spirit visions or divination. See spirits, demons, the future, or even just the truth about yourself. This is 21st century crystal ball gazing for the reddit crowd.

It's also pretty simple. It doesn't require a particular time or another person. It's (relatively) safe, as long as you are careful and are thorough with your preparations and your clean-up.

Here's what you'll need, and how to do it.

Checklist:

    A dark room with no visual or auditory distractions.

    A prayer or cleansing ritual.

    A computer monitor or laptop screen that can illuminate your face.

    An iPad (or similar glassy tablet) with a stand that you can stare into.

    A desire to see something, or someone. It could be a truth about yourself, or a spirit, or just something weird.

Setup:

Next, open something big and white on your computer (maximizing Notepad on Windows, for instance) to cause your monitor to cast a white glow onto your face. When it's time to start scrying, turn off all other lights in the room.

Set your iPad (or other tablet, or some other black yet reflective surface, such as a photo frame with the back of the glass spray painted black) on your desk roughly where your keyboard is. You want to be able to casually look down and see your own dimly illuminated face, but nothing else.

Finally, you'll also need a ritual cleansing. This is done to clear both the physical space around you as well as to get your head right for the work you are about to do.

Most of you probably don't know a cleansing ritual (or banishing ritual as it's often known), so relax, breath deeply and regularly, and then say a prayer. The Prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel is popular for this kind of thing.

    Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle; be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray: and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.

The Ritual

    Perform your cleansing ritual (probably a prayer to Saint Michael, spoken out loud).

    Next, take slow and even breaths. Avoid blinking or refocusing on any particular part of your reflection. Instead, look just beyond yourself, not quite focusing on any particular point.

With each inhalation, think of who or what you are trying to see. Do the same with each exhalation. Slow and even, each breath focused on visualizing what you want to see. Use each breath as an opportunity to re-center your mind on your goal. This doesn't have to be a specific person or thing. It could be a particular truth about yourself, or just the desire to see what's beyond your normal vision.

Continue the slow, even breathing and maintain your empty-minded focus until you've seen what you wanted to see, or decide you don't want to see anymore. I suggest a minimum of ten minutes. You probably shouldn't do this for more than an hour. When finished, say, out loud, "I have seen."

3) Then, turn a light on and perform your cleansing ritual (prayer) again.

4) Finally, relax. Laugh a bit, and then do something to ground you in reality. Watch some TV, eat some chips, talk to some friends.

If this is something you're interested in doing more than once, keep a journal of your experiences. If something interesting happened, and you feel generous, share it here.

Opening the Door - mirrors plus doors! 1 player.

[RECIPE] Opening the Door
Approved Rituals

You need two mirrors, preferably about half as tall as you are and about as wide. You'll need a door that opens into a dark room. You'll need a candle. The rest is just dressing.

Put one mirror inside a dark room so that when you stand in the doorway, you can see yourself and the space behind you. You shouldn't fill the mirror, but you shouldn't be too small in it either. Play with the distance, then shut the door.

On the other side of the door, set up a card table and a chair, or two chairs facing each other. The chair you will sit in should have it's back to the door so that when you Open the Door, the mirror outside will be reflected in the inside mirror. It's sometimes interesting to have a pack of cards with you (ordinary deck works just as well as the Tarot), but isn't essential. If this is your first time, maybe skip the pack of cards.

If you've never done anything like this before, you might want a talisman or fetish, some token of power you can cling to. Pick up one of those wooden crosses they sell at hobby and craft stores for a buck. It'll do even if you're an atheist. Feels good in your hand.

Put the candle on the table or the floor (use some fire safety sense here, people) so that it illuminates the mirror, but isn't overly bright and isn't in you direct line of vision. You'll be staring at the mirror, and you don't want the flame to sear phosphenes into your vision. If you like, you can add in whitenoise from a fan, radio tuned to static, a white noise machine or app. Even the steady ticking of a clock or metronome can help drown out distractions.

Now sit. Make sure your bladder is empty, your stomach is full, and you won't be needlessly interrupted. It's a good idea to have a spotter of some kind, if only so you don't accidentally burn down your house. They need to leave you alone, though. Agree on a time frame. Night is obviously better, but it's possible to Open the Door in the day time as long as you can get your house nearly completely dark.

You'll stare into the mirror. It'll take fifteen minutes to half an hour or so for distortions to arise. If you haven't practiced motionlessness, you're going to feel restless. It may even hurt to sit still. You can move a little, but don't get up, and don't interrupt your view of your reflection. Stare mostly at your face. If you haven't practiced single-mindedness, your thoughts will wander. Let them. You'll experience doubt, anxiety, boredom, and you may feel very silly. That's fine. Sit. Stare.

Whispers, skittering, visual distortions, something moving across your skin. Once this sort of activity begins, you can choose simply to wait and observe it. Just keep your eyes on your reflection. Once it picks up some momentum, grab your pack of cards. Keep staring at the mirror. Draw a card one at a time from the deck and hold it up. Try some variations: show the face of the card to the mirror so that you "both" can see it, hold it facing you so that you can see it, but your reflection cannot, or hold it up behind your peripheral vision, so that neither of you can see what's on the card. Go through the whole deck, or just do a few cards. Or don't do it at all.

What you're waiting for is a moment of climax, when your emotions have peaked. Even if it's disappointment that after forty-five minutes, you've done nothing but listened to a faucet run in another room and counted your freckles. When you can't stand it anymore, stand up, turn around, and Open the Door. It's best to do it quickly, but keep your hand on the door so that you can slam it shut again if you need to.

Some Notes

The candle: It may be helpful to place the candle behind the outside mirror. There should still be enough light to see by, but it won't be directly in your field of vision. When you Open the Door, though, there may not be enough light reaching the inner door. You can place a dim light source in the dark room, but don't use a candle (fire safety!). A low-heat electric light source (such as the flashlight app on a smartphone) covered with a t-shirt to dim it should work. Place it either behind the inner mirror, or behind the arc of the door as it opens. I did this once with the flashlight app on my phone set to strobe. That was sort of interesting.

The use of a talisman: You should have this either in your hand or on your lap or on the table in front of you, in view of the mirror. If you feel you need to, hold it up to the mirror. A good way to know when things are starting to happen is that the talisman will seem to disappear from the reflection, but don't keep looking for it. Gaze forward. When you go to Open the Door, keep your talisman in your hand.

Proscriptions: Being in an unstable mental state, induced by life events or mind altering substances, isn't the best time to go mucking about with the relationship between your conscious and unconscious mind. That said, don't forgo any medication prescribed to you. Typically, people like combine 'rituals' such as these with entheogens. If you decide to do this, a spotter is a must, because you are very likely going to have a bad trip. Depressants will probably just dull the experience too much to be notable. Dissociatives will be unpredictable and possibly very dangerous. I didn't mention it above, and I probably should have, but keep a flashlight handy or a lightswitch nearby. This will help you avoid stumbling around in the dark with a mirror perched precariously on a chair if the candle goes out.

Final note: You can use more than one mirror, but start with just the two. Additional mirrors can go in the dark room, flanking the original mirror, or in the sitting area, behind and beside the main mirror. Don't look into any of the other mirrors in the sitting area. They should all be visibly reflected when you Open the Door.

Curious as to what you see in the mirror when you open the door, but seeing that it involves mirrors I won't be trying it. Mirrors are just a big nope for me!

Depends. Once I saw an unfamiliar city behind me. Another time, as I was opening the door, I saw two reflections of myself on either side of the reflection of the door's edge as it passed. The reflection on the outside edge of the door showed me, the mirror behind me on the table, and my darknened apartment. On the inside edge of the door, I saw my reflection as it appeared in the mirror on the table, looking gaunt and wasted, wearing a fiendish grin.

I have seen in the inside mirror a reflection of a creature sitting atop the outside mirror, peering into it. It looked like a tiny, reptilian homunculus. It looked up at me, and I shut the door. Once, the distortions in the outside mirror were extreme. My reflection looked as though it were pressed against the glass and struggling. I could hear muffled shouts and dull, distant thuds. I quickly opened the door and saw the outside mirror reflected in the inside mirror, only the distorted reflection receeded rapidly toward a vanishing point. This is the time I had a strobe light going. I wish I hadn't, for while it heightened the visual effect, it also shook me out of a meditative state.

Often, I don't see anything particularly noteworthy when I open the door, but there is nonetheless a change. A kind of epiphany, even if it can't be verbalized, occurs, or can occur. So you don't really need mirorrs, I guess. Just get yourself in a trance state, and when you feel your emotions peak, get up and open the door. The mirrors add a visual medium for your brain to work with, the same way white noise adds an aural component.

If you're primarily looking for a thirll, instead of Opening the Door, you could try Opening the Window. Same set up, except instead of a door behind you, you have a window with the shade drawn. It needs to be nighttime, and there should be some ambient light outside, but not much. When you're ready, get up, and lift the shade. What do you see?

Deep Well ritual. [RECIPE]
Approved Rituals

This is a simple ritual to have a past life reveal itself to you by getting you into a meditative state with the use of music and a few other items.

This ritual has been done by a handful of people I know who claim they experienced something and really enjoyed it.

Here is the Ritual:

Attempt at night or in a dark and quiet place.

You will need: A white candle A hand mirror/table mirror Incense of your choice, I prefer Dragonsblood. This audio file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9dxwpbgtdry3azp/01%20DeepWell.wav?dl=0 The file has 30 seconds of silence before starting and it is 20 mins long.

You will seat yourself at a table, light the candle and place it so that it shines onto your face. Light the incense and play the audio file. Stare into the mirror and repeat this sentence: Oracle of Light, Send me the Second Sight.

Keep staring and repeating the words. Use your breath to find a rhythm.

If you have an experience I'd love to hear it!

This is an experiment to seek information from inside yourself. Interfacing with yourself. It's contemplation with meditation and sensual aids like the incense and candle and music to get your mind to focus. However, maybe the information that comes through could be surprising or disturbing (or vague, there's that too) and that could have an effect on you, and how you see yourself and maybe how you perceive other things. So if there is a caution, I would say perhaps, do you want to know? And are you prepared to know what you didn't expect or hope for?

It seemed to be mostly visual. Visual information that appeared in the reflection. One friend told me that he saw his face change into what he thought was other lives. This person wasn't someone who made up things just be able to say "something" happened, however he was very open to the concept as well. Someone else told me they saw environments, like trees.

Hi, traditionally a white candle is symbolic for truth, spiritual growth, a red candle is symbolic for things like vitality and love so I'd stay with a white candle unless red has a personal meaning for you.

Tunnels - mirror game. 1 player.

Posted byu/BanzaiGenkidama

Tunnels
Approved Rituals

Have you ever noticed that whenever a mirror is reflected into another mirror, after multiple reflections it begins to fade into a darker and greener infinity? The mirror can be cracked or completely unblemished; it simply does not matter. The light will always disappear and greenify the deeper the reflection tunnel runs. It is not wise for one to purposely create these tunnels, but for the curious, which I’m assuming you are, they are at least very interesting. Secondly, yes, you’re doppelganger does live as your immediate reflection on the surface of the mirror. The good news is they are harmless. They live as you do, as clueless to as you when they see you in their reflection. Why should they question your intentions when they have none themselves? They live with as much or as little peace as you do in a single reflection. It need not matter the day, place, or position of the moon for this to occur, though the darker it is, the easier it is for them to approach. It would also be a good idea to note the precise time at which you begin for reasons that will be made clear later. You must have two large mirrors facing each other with roughly one meter between them. Stand between them, and do not make a sound. In fact, the location you choose must be free from any extraneous noise. This is of the most upmost importance. They frighten easily, especially in the beginning. You must be able to see your entire reflection in the mirror you decide to face. Count as many frames as you possibly can over your reflection’s shoulder until the greenness and darkness swallows the last remnants of the reflection. Depending on the amount of light in your location, this should take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes. Feel free to take your time. As your eyes strain to count the last visible frame, you should notice pale shapes emerge in the furthest green of the mirror tunnel before they retreat into their infinity again. This may just be a trick of the mind at first, but slowly you will begin to see them more and more frequently. Once they begin appearing at more and more regular intervals, you may notice an uneasy expression appear on your reflection’s face although you may feel your own face at ease. Step out from between the mirrors immediately at this point, exit the room you were in, and lock the door behind you. They have awakened. If on the second day you feel as curious as the first, you may repeat the same process as described above. It must begin at the exact same time you had started the previous day, hence having write it down. Those things that you may have glimpsed at for only a few seconds may reappear more readily if you have earned their favor. Your reflection may appear a bit shaken, but that is only a trick of the mind and nothing you need to worry about. Once you have finished counting back as many frames as possible, blink only once to refocus yourself. You should not close your eyes again, not that you actually could if you wanted to. You may begin to notice that they appear not only in the darkest frame of the tunnel, but now in closer frames. You can’t make out anything that could be considered a face, give or take the blur of what could resemble teeth. Don’t let your curiosity blind you. Looking for human similarities in them is fruitless, even though you will continue to try to understand them. If ever they appear in any frame less than 6 away from your own reflection, they have become too comfortable with you and you with them. They have become too beautiful to ignore. You have become too focused on them to notice your own reflection, pointing, warning you about the thing reaching through the mirror behind you.

Waiting for Godot - mirror recipe. 2 players.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[RECIPE] Waiting for Godot(self.threekings)
submitted 7 years ago by WaryLouka to /r/threekings

Waiting for Godot is a very scary, but nice experience to do. It is not dangerous at all! (according to my friend)

It is one of the "mirror" recipes you may find lying around ( like Bloody Mary ). I didn't tried it, so post your experiences here. It goes like this:

THINGS YOU NEED:

    A Friend
    A Flashlight
    A Mirror
    A Watch for your friend
    A Piece of paper and a pencil

STEPS:

1) Place your mirror in front of you, at exactly 3:33 AM. If you use a bathroom mirror (non-movable), make sure you stand at least one time in front of it for around 10 seconds at the same time. After the 10 seconds, write randomly a word on the piece of paper, and put it behind the mirror. ( For a bathroom mirror, put it in front of it. )

2) You need to wait until 6:59. Meanwhile, you can play some games with your friend or browse the Internet. Do anything you wish.

3) When 6:59 AM arrives, you must go to the room that contains the mirror ( You got only one minute! ) without your friend, close the door, and close the light. Just stand in front of the mirror. If you do not arrive on time, or didn't stand at the mirror, or turned off the lights, or closed the door, stop the ritual.

4) One minute later, your friend must place itself near the door, with the flashlight ready. You can talk with your friend if you wish, but don't stop looking at the mirror!

5) At exactly 7:06 AM, 36 Seconds (That's why your friend need a watch!), your friend must open the door and point the flashlight at the mirror. Don't worry if the flashlight don't arrive on the mirror at 36 Seconds, a second late doesn't change something. If anything happens that prevent the flashlight from being pointed to the mirror, stop the ritual.

6) If done correctly, when the light will "touch" the mirror, your word should show up on the glass! Keep it as long as you wish. Once the light is removed, the word will get remplaced with a face of a male being. Look at the mirror as long as you wish.

7) Simply stop looking at the mirror to stop the ritual. You will remark that whatever was written on your paper will be reversed and drawn with a weird mixture of blue/black ink.

If you need to stop the ritual, simply carry on! Remove the mirror, trash the paper, et cetera... It will end the ritual. I don't know the source, I learnt it from my friend. I'll ask him someday where he got the recipe.

I repeat, it's not dangerous at all, and if you make a mistake, nothing will hurt you nor impact anything.

The time is also linked to the recipe. Imagine minutes could go beyond the limit of 60 minutes. Basically, the time will reach 6:66, 66 Seconds at the end of the ritual.

Why do you call it Waiting for Godot? I haven't read the book, but is it there a reference?
permalinkredditceddit
[–]WaryLouka (deleted by user)2 points7 years ago

Well, principally because you wait for someone to appear ( that face ). Also, there's two persons involved in this recipe. In Waiting for Godot, there's also two persons.

This recipe may or may not work, just like Godot can appear, or not.

Interesting concept, but is there any point to this ritual? Anything to gain? Or is it just to see that guy's face?

It's just to see that guy's face.

[RECIPE] Something I played as a kid
Approved Rituals

I’ve been reading a lot of the Three Kings posts which lead to reading about other games and reminded me of a game I played with my friends as a kid. This game is nowhere near as creepy as Three Kings but I thought you might like it.

As kids my best friend and I would sit across from one another in a dark room, with just enough light to barely be able to see the other person’s facial features. We sat about one foot away from each other. The goal was to see who could stare at the other person’s face the longest without freaking out or quitting.

I haven’t done this since I was a little kid but when I started to think back on it today my memories of the game seemed odd. When we would first start playing the rounds lasted less than a minute and we be laughing hysterically as we described the scary ways we saw each other’s faces. But as the game went on we would get quieter (strangely quiet for 8 year olds), the rounds would last a lot longer and the transformations became much more disturbing.

Thought you guys might want to try it. At least you don’t have to play this one alone.

When my sister and I used to share a bed as kids, she would tell me I wasn't allowed to face her. I asked her why and she told me that my face changed so I looked like a gaping corpse with black sockets.

This sounds like a bit of a variation of the Faces in the Mirror (not the exact title, but I'm sure it's close). I did read a comment somewhere about someone staring into their loved ones face and it distorting much like the Faces in the Mirror. Sounds interesting, I'd love to hear some stories.

A Gathering of 100 Tales - tell scary tales in front of a mirror and entertain any nearby entities until the entity begins to entertain you. 2+ players (enough to tell 100 tales).

[RECIPE] A Gathering of 100 Tales
Approved Rituals

I'm actually surprised no one has submitted this one yet, but I'm a bit of a horror and mythology buff, so I guess not everyone is as obsessed as I am with that sort of thing. This is traditionally called 'Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai', or 'A Gathering of 100 Supernatural Tales', but I figured for the rest of us, it might be best to just call it 'A Gathering of 100 Tales'. Many of the stories involved in this game are actually only a sentence or two long. That is the general tradition of a basic Kaidan, though they may be as short or as long as the teller likes.

For a bit of history: This was actually a fairly popular parlor game in the Edo period of Japan. Generally played at parties for the upper class when they were experiencing a particular desire for the spooky realms of entertainment, rarely was it ever completed properly, and I've set to see any actual evidence of it being finished at all. For the sake of modernizing the game, I've changed the rules just a little, but the essence of the game/ritual is still intact.

Instructions:

What you'll need

    As many guests as it takes to tell 100 stories.

    100 candles (100 lit andons/paper lanterns if you're feeling really fancy)

    100 stories, obviously

    3 separate rooms (preferrably connected)

    A small mirror

    A small table

    Position the mirror on the table in the third room.

    Place the 100 lit candles (or paper lanterns/andons) in the third room.

    Ensure all lights are off.

    Have all guests gather in the first room.

    As a group, begin to cycle through each story you have to tell, which must be scary or unusual in nature.

    After the completion of each story, the teller must go to the second room, and then the third, picking a candle/andon to extinguish, before returning to the first room. Keep repeating until every single candle/andon is blown out.

    After 100 stories have been told, all guests must gather in the third room and kneel in front of the table where the mirror has been placed.

    There will be an entity in the mirror. Good or bad is uncertain. It depends on whoever lingered long enough to listen to the telling of each story.

    Pick one person to speak to the entity, to communicate with it. Ask all questions you may have through that person, so that they may talk to it.

Warnings/Tips:

    It is pretty much not guaranteed whether you summon something good or evil.

    Every guest must be willing to remain to the final tale, or this will not work.

    If you have any doubt in your mind, any fear, any suspicions, then listen to them. All of these stories together will be employing an awful lot of fear and dark energy. It is very unlikely that anything lingering in the mirror is something you'll want to communicate with.

    The general agreement of this game was that the entity summoned was in fact the 'spirit of fear'. Not really something I'd suggest talking to.

I've heard of this and have played it, but with different instructions. These seem a lot better, when I played nothing happened - I think I did it wrong. For anyone that doesn't know, this game was featured on an episode of Paranormal State.

Where did you hear of this? I enjoy Japanese myths, but haven't heard of anything similar.

And thanks for sharing! Indexed.

There's a Wikipedia entry for it if you want to read further. It's definitely a classic. :)

Making your Kine Dagger
Approved Rituals

I write this after seeing a disturbing number of posts which end in horrific nightmares for those participating in rituals and recipes. I hope that by trying this, you can avoid some of the terrifying results are fellows have had.

So what is a Kine Dagger? Well, it is a sort of mental weapon which can be used to defeat most mental intrusions by a hostile entity. It can also help if you simply have recurring nightmares. Basically it is an exercise which is used to fill in details of a manifestation of your will so thoroughly that you can call it up at any time, conscious or not. It becomes an object which you know every single detail of an can be used as an anchor to help form yourself around.

Now I was lucky in tat I have some swordsmithing ability and access to a forge and detailing tools and as such was able to make a physical representation for myself. For the purposes of this guide, however, I will be teaching you how to construct one from paper, pencils, and effort.

Ok, so first thing you need to do is to sketch a picture of your favorite type of dagger, gladius, short sword, misericord, whatever small bladed weapon you like most. I would recommend making a sketch of a family heirloom as a base if it is available. Now take a long time with this sketch, give it your best artistic ability. I am talking like 10 hours of drawing and refining here, so make it perfect and as lifelike as possible. The key is to truly ingrain the details and shape into your mind.

The next step is customization. You are going to want to put some meaningful symbols or words onto the blade now. You may choose to put any number of runes, prayers if you have a religion, or simply an ascertation of your will. Personally, I engraved the prayer to Saint Michael along the blade as it fits with my faith nicely. Whatever you choose, make it something about exercising unwanted entities and giving yourself control. The final step is that somewhere along the instrument you need to write out the following sentence. "This is my will; with it I cast you away." Or a native translation to that effect.

Ok, so you have spent about 15-20 hours drawing this incredibly detailed piece of art. That is some serious dedication right there, you should be proud. Now I want you to study this picture. Look at every detail, memorize the curve and shape of that blade. Imagine the feel of it if you were to hold it. I want you to be able to read every single detail off of the blade if you were to close your eyes and imagine this. The key to this whole exercise is creating a perfect mental copy of the piece you just produced.

Now the key to building this picture is repetition. I would recommend making a dot on the back of one of your hands. Every time you see that dot throughout the day, I want you to try to perfectly visualize that blade in your mind's eye. After about three weeks of this, you should start seeing the dot appear in your dreams. Once that occurs, you will be able to draw up the dagger in nearly any mental state.

I use this as a way to defend myself in nightmares, as a rock to form my will around, or even just as an anchor to prove if things are real or not. Can you make a blade materialize in your hands? If so, the situation is probably not real. I hope that this will help you all, stay safe.

I don't do rituals, but I'm going to try this for nightmares. I occasionally have dreams where I'm fighting someone, but punching them does nothing. Maybe if I can use a dagger in those dreams, I'll actually get somewhere.

I know this post is from awhile ago, but I can actually vouch for the whole idea of it. I don't know how it came about, but in my bad dreams, I began to start imagining a pair of binoculars when I felt really scared (I have no idea why), and it would wake me up. Now I know that if I'm not having a good time in my dreams (and I'm usually always aware it's a dream) I just imagine the pair of binoculars in my hands and it wakes me up immediately.

DIY Exorcism for Beginners and More - For When Things Keep Going Bump In the Night

A FRIEND unnammed and fairly unfamiliar with the occult recently asked me to send them a banishing ceremony; she's been having problems with what she describes as a "nightmare room." I went through something similar, and sent her this from my notes. Thought I would share, and ask anyone to please comment with their own stories of dealing with similar "entities" and what banishing methods you've employed?

SAGE is like a spiritual anti-bacterial cleaner. Even JUST BY BURNING IT you can relieve your personal space and aura of impurities. However, it goes a lot further when you physically connect your spirit and psychically connect your physical environment to the process.

This is a simple ceremony, I've hijacked elements from various sources and combined them, so keep in mind that when it comes to performing ceremonies, the secret is; Anything goes. Really, this is just what worked for me, so consider the following instructions merely variables at your disposal; feel free to change or omit any of it's parts as you see fit. (The sage is I believe your only real necessary component, but if you find something that works better than that go for it, I just haven't found anything more direct.)

It can either really help or really hurt to have another person in on the ceremony, depending on their energies. I recommend finding someone you're comfortable with, open minded enough for the ceremony, but also sound enough in their own body/soul to not interfere with or suffer from the exorcism. That being said, it is entirely possible to do this alone.

ALSO this ceremony works best if you physically clean the space before hand; vacuum, broom, wipes, the whole nine yards. You can use that time to mentally prepare yourself for the ceremony, I've always found cleaning very meditative.

***You should get yourself; ***1) a bundle of sage for burning (ceremonial "smudging" stick) (any New Age store should carry this, some botanicas, I've even found it at whole foods.) It can be any combo of herbs, but sage should be the main ingredient. I found White Sage w/ Dragonsblood Resin works best for removal of negative entities, but anything sage will do. You can even use kitchen sage if it comes to that)

2) Some sort of feather to spread the smoke around, those places listed above should carry them, but you can even use a piece of paper or a duster.

3) Ceremonial water bowl w/ "holy" water- This can just be a small bowl full of salted water that you add a few springs of rosemary/sage/whatever and mutter a few blessings over. That makes it sacred enough. I like to use a singing bowl and fill it with just a bit of water, and vibrate the whole thing while chanting. Some people like to go out to an orthodox church and get themselves something priest blessed, but even tap water works nicely, as long as you "believe" it's sacred.
4) It's up to you to incorporate some sort of personal "mantra" for your ceremony. Basically this can be a word or a phrase or a spell that you feel connects you with a higher "Self" while also cleaning out negativity. I like to use "Om Sat Tat" from vedic literature along with yod-heh-vav-heh, The "Our Father" prayer works great as well; even just "om". Whatever you can memorize and resonate with.

THE CEREMONY

First, take a bath or a shower. If it's a bath throw some rosemary or lavender in there, anything fragrant you can foster calmness and impassive detachment.

Next, robe yourself in something simple and clean something you don't usually wear; maybe a white shirt/pants or a robe or a dress.

Gather your supplies. If you can, set up a small "altar" in the center of the room in which you wish to focus your ritual (wherever the forces seem to be at their worst) and set your materials on it.

From that center, focus yourself on your task and your mantra. Just like people wear dust masks when they do heavy cleaning/dusting, you should arm yourself with a barrier to the spiritual sludge that gets drudged up when you perform this ritual. For that reason I believe you can use any protective element you feel personally connected to; a god or goddess. ancestral spirits; I like to evoke the four cardinal points for protection via the archangels. You can evoke their name (by singing or humming or just speaking to them) and facing their direction.

URIELyu-ree-el^ : Cardinal Angel of the Northern Corner, Elemental Angel of Earth

GABRIEL, Gah-Bree-El^ : Cardinal Angel of the Western Corner, Elemental Angel of Water

RAPHAEL. Ra-Fie-El^ : Cardinal Angel of the Eastern Corner, Elemental Angel of Air

MICHAEL Mee-Chai-El^ : Cardinal Angel of the Southern Corner, Elemental Angel of Fire

Whatever you chose, be polite, humble, and address them directly. Imagine them now around you; focus the energy you ask for as if it's surrounding you from the inside with a brilliant white light. Keep that light with you.

Next, light the sage bundle, and gently spread the smoke about your person; starting with around your feet and ending with around your head, while singing/chanting/muttering your MANTRA. Use the feather to fan the smoke around you, and sprinkle a few drops of the Holy Water on your head, anoint your forehead with it (in a cross, a pentagram, whatever symbol you feel connected with). Feel out any negative spots in your own body, places where it seems the light is patchy or shadowy. You may even feel pain or pressure; focus your breath on these points and let the smoke pool around any of those areas. imagine the light around you getting "cleaned" shined and brightened.

Then, moving slowly, still keeping your mantra, take the sage bundle and feather, and spread smoke into every corner of the corner of the room, Sprinkle drops of holy water from the ceremonial bowl as you go. Imagine the smoke choking out the darkness in your room, replacing it with the same cloak of light that surrounds you. At first as you go around, the smoke from the sage will actually flicker and curl and almost appear to "spark"; this is a cleansing property of sage at work. Continue fanning the smoke into every corner and crevice and closet until you feel you have successfully exorcised the room. Keep at your Mantra. The smoke should start to look different; you should see bigger, fuller plumes, and steadier streams. Continue on and do this to EVERY ROOM in the house spreading your mantra, the smoke, and the white light everywhere (including doors and windows!) Return to where you started when you're done. The light that encompassed you now shines in every corner of your whole house. Keep this image of light in your head.

Thank and bless the spirits who you originally called on to protect you, and let them depart peacefully until you may need them again.

Let the light continue to emanate. Bless yourself with the smoke one last time, From head to toe now, and then exit the ceremony by putting the smoking sage out into the remainder of the holy water.

Finally, take a deep breath, and LAUGH. Laugh at yourself, laugh at the shadows, laugh at the ridiculous ceremony you just did, and clear the air and banish it all by laughing along with the light. Then go change, watch TV, smoke a joint, and chill out. Get some rest.

Hope this helps;

***Author's Aside - Notes from a Personal Encounter ***

The first time I ever recorded (I'm a musician) was out in Pennsylvania with an old school rocker, whose ex-wife was reputably possessed in the house we were staying in. Multiple people familiar with the events told me they had seen her go from quiet, pleasant woman, to spitting perfect Latin in a low voice, head spinning around, convulsive, destructive and sudden impulsive behavior; the whole nine yards. According to the story, it all got so bad one night her husband and his friend threw her into the van, her fighting tooth and nail, and "emergency exorcised her" at the local church. They all swore by the miracle of god that the church's doors just so happened to be wide open in the middle of the night, empty, with all the lights on, the candles and incense burning in the back, bowl of holy water at the ready, and bible page open to the perfect verse. She struggled, but they read the verses aloud and threw the water on her, and after a few minutes of screaming bloody murder, and her husband reading the verses, suddenly, she was back. She claimed to have no memory of the night's events. They divorced for apparently unrelated reasons years later. I listened to the story with interest, but disregarded this fable as just that; a history about a poor woman with mental and marital issues blown into folkloric proportions at best.

A few days into the session, I began having vivid dreams in the house; first about two children spirits who were trapped there, who it seemed were trying to warn me about something, and then about...something Else. It tried to interweave himself into my dreams, and at first it seemed harmless. We were playing games.

The games started simple, like pong, then chess, and eventually got more and more...severe. He started to become more embodied, and wanted me to turn on people close to me, to hurt my family. I quickly realized what he was, called him out, and shouted"Get out of my head!" and the dream ripped open into flames and he roared with a demonic scream. I awoke, shaken.

When we left Pennsylvania a few days later, I could feel whatever it was had followed me to Brooklyn. I had sleep paralysis dreams for the first time in my life, multiple ones, and every time He would be in the corner of the room, gently manifesting himself out of the darkness. I struggled with the paralysis, and even flew out of my body at times to scream at him... "GET OUT, GET OUT!" and then the dream would end, only to continue again the next night.

I became familiar with his presence during this time, and he began to refer to himself as "The Hog King." In his manifested form he had on a top hat and cane; what felt like remnants of a soul he once fed off of in the 1920's. His face and posture evokes that era. There is something unspeakably terrifying about him to me, and I know he wants in.

During one night of heavy sleep paralysis, I called out in desperation to my friend Cody who lived a few blocks down from me at the time and he actually came to my aid in my dream; he showed up and talked me through it at my bedside but I could feel the force kind of laugh at the attempt, and I felt it now begin watching my friend, myself unable to communicate.

I called Cody upon awakening and he confirmed he had in fact just awoken from the same dream; asleep, he had felt himself suddenly called to my bedside, to coax me through something.

After that night, my dreams were suddenly gone. Not good or bad, just... nothing. This was unusual for me, for even in the midst of a heavy pot binge I have some sort of vague memory of my dreams but now they were suddenly gone completely. During the day I felt exhausted, strange; removed.

I thought He was gone too, but then after a few days Cody admitted to me that he had started having nightmares. Sleep paralysis. Man in a top hat. I decided this was not normal, something had to be done.

We performed the ceremony above in both of our apartments to incredible results. Nightmares were gone; my dreams were back and pleasantly vivid. I remember sleeping really well.

The next time I encountered the "Hog King" was actually about a year later, inside another dream I was having, about staying with some very (ancient!) old women in the country. They were knitting something together, (The Fates?) and in their house, I found and read a book called "The Hog King" and fell asleep. And in this dream within a dream, I found myself in His uncanny realm...

I was at a table in the midst of a forest clearing, surrounded by shadowy cartoon-ish figures; a rabbit, a man wearing antlers, a doe...) They all talked to me in canned responses, and referred to me by "The Reader." It felt like something of an automated answering machine. I waited.

Then a figure emerged from the distance, cloaked in a sort of electric black fire; I knew it was Him. He appeared ragged, slightly worn out. Like he'd been gone for sometime. And when I came face to face with Him, we actually talked as equals. He expressed concern at my coming to his realm; it was not somewhere I belonged. He seemed genuinely surprised I had sought council with him, after all that he had tried on me. It seems he was actually impressed at being bested, and we formed a sort of friendship. I felt that he is not fact is not inherently Evil, as I once believed, just very selfish and lost. He preys on weakness, and therefore is weak himself. He has, since our conversation, actually become a sort of psychic protector of mine. Whatever He is. He helps me in dreams sometimes, and I help him regain his own light.

Proof that conquering your biggest weaknesses can turn them into your greater strengths.

Cosmic Sword - a useful tool to sever connections from dark entities. 1 person. 1

[RECIPE] Severing connections to evil entities
Approved Rituals

Ok so this is something odd i recieved from my grandmother when she heard i was dabbling in the supernatural she left 2 sheets of paper on my desk that read as follows.

Applied metaphysics will disarm negative connections: Sit in a comfortable chair. Put your feet flat on the ground and close your eyes. Take a few deep breaths to calm yourself and center yourself. With your eyes closed, visualize your self standing straight and tall Now see yourself holding a large sword that emits a vibrant blue flame. Feel it. Sense the energy that comes out of it. This is your Cosmic Sword. Breathe in its power. See it. Hear it. Own it. When you feel as though you own it, say this:

"I deserve to recieve and use this Cosmic sword." "It is my birthright as a sovereign soul in oneness with(your name). I AM the
Cosmic sword!" Take another deep breath and center all your power and love within you in your heart. Keep repeating the statement as many times as you need until you know that you own it. Now have to sever the cords these beings have on you. Visualize your body first with black ropy cords attaching you to these being. Then repeat as you visualize yourself cutting the cords above,below,side-to-side, and front and back. Also State, "All 'cutting',is instantaneous and interdimensional." "I use my Cosmic Sword to cut my cords of connection with dark force entities."

"I cut all connections made to my energies by dark force entities by images projected into my mind, during dreamstate." "I cut these cords mentally. I cut these cords physically. I cut these cords emotionally and intellectually" I cut these cords sexually" I cut these cords spiritually. I cut these cords karmically. "I cut these cords in all my lifetimes past, present, and future. I cut these cords simultaneously and instantaneously from all agreement and contracts, known and unknown with dark force entitits and aliens". "The Totality of my soul is free from dark force entities." "I declare (your full name) free from dark entities and aliens". You may need to sever the cords of connection many times before they remain cut and are completely disengaged. Do not give up. This process may need to be done over the course of a few days or weeks after awakening from nightmares or panic attacks.

Thats what the paper read I hope you guys enjoy

I didn't mention this before as I had not used the ritual when I posted it but this can be used in doors of the mind or any other place you are in ethereal form. Though this isn't exactly a christian ritual but a ritual regarding the one true god something so intricate it cannot be given a name or religion anyways if you worship any dark forces stay away from this ritual unless you seek refuge of the "One true God" As the flames consume anything evil and if you yourself are Evil or consider yourself evil please do not attempt this thank you.

Thank you for this, it's an excellent tool and comforting exercise to do. Do you suggest all users who may lean towards darker works not do this at all or could it perhaps be altered to accommodate certain energies? I do not consider myself "evil" per se but I've some nasty emotional hooks in me I'd like to sever or at least take a good chunk out of. Thanks again and I look forward to reading more from you.

Well I don't reccomend making deals with entities or evil ones at that. Anyways the blue flame consumes all evil and if you had made a contract with an evil entity they will not take kindly to being expelled from your mind for this is a way to nullify contracts. If this makes sense.

It does. I haven't made any such contracts, it's more so that my practices delve into arts typically "darker" (ie performing curses, etc) so my energy is different. There are things within me as a result of evil deeds done to me so perhaps I'm a bit warped. Could such a ritual still benefit me?

Not the OP, but I would put forth that there are different schools of thought on this, and the one I tend to ascribe to suggests that soul pieces that have been "damaged" are actually separated from you at the point of trauma in order to protect them from the full emotional impact. (Psychologically this is observed in victims of abuse or people with multiple personality disorders or other dissociative disorders.) I'm not going to say you do or don't have "things" in you but if you do perform this ritual, understand that it's going to really suck right after; removing whatever's been filling the void is going to make you feel that soul loss all over again. I would do some research on journeying and plan a way to begin searching for and reclaiming those lost soul pieces once you've removed whatever you feel you need to remove, so that you're not floundering and feeling those missing bits without realizing why. ❤️❤️

I see this is actually a very comforting reply and I appreciate your input. You're not far off the path at all with my situation, I do seek to remove some emotional connections that people have left in me over time but it's as you said there are certain things that probably should not be moved and those are the things I'd rather be left as they are for safety. So from what I gather a ritual like this would probably cleanse things not meant to be. Which makes absolute sense. I'd probably clean too much out at once haha. I've done a few exercises similar to this in that you visualize cutting cords and what they're connected to which is what drew me to this recipe.

A PSA and Q&A for those who want to try the more dangerous games.
Advice

Hello! I've been reading through a lot of these games and rituals and decided to pitch my two pennies in to maybe end up helping someone, so I decided to share a bit of my knowledge about these things in two forms: A PSA and Q&A. I'll be answering whichever questions you have about these things for as long as there are questions and no question is dumb when it concerns your safety, so please, ask away in the comments!

Now, I know most won't need this, but I am certain that there are a few around who might end up stumbling onto something potentially dangerous that they have no way to deal with, so let's level the playing field, shall we?

    First of all: UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, DO NOT TRY SUMMONING RITUALS/GAMES. I cannot overstate this. By summoning something, you are opening a door. Funny thing about doors: once they are open, anything can go through them until they are closed. Most of the time, whatever you summon to play with will be the least of your problems.

    Powerful entities have better things to do than play with humans. Whatever you summon is probably a trickster, something that is amused by humans or at the bottom of the food chain. Now, that doesn't mean that they aren't dangerous. They can be very lethal, but you (probably) won't summon something serious using these rituals.

And now, for safety tips:

    If for some reason you go through with opening the door and bringing something into your home (home, not house. The distinction is important), it is your guest. It must obey your rules. ALWAYS preface the summoning with rules. How you do it is up to you, but here is an example:

    (As preparation, set a plate of food (can be anything, from a slice of bread to a small amount of salt) and a glass of some drink (usually water, but again can be anything.) in front of the door, circle or whatever the entity will come through, then stare at the point of entrance without fear (also very important, more on that later).)

    Say: "This is my home and I am its master. I invite you in, to remain until (Time you want it to go away. You probably shouldn't let it stay until after sunrise.). While you are here, you are forbidden from causing harm to me and my other guests and should I tell you to leave, you'll leave and never set foot in this home again. If you agree to these rules, step in. If not, go away and never come back."

This will always work if it's your home (more on that later), even if you aren't confident in yourself or stuttering the whole time due to fear. If it's an apartment, a house that you rented, an hotel or somewhere that isn't your home, it should work somewhat, but you might have to pitch in.

    The main tool of a mage is faith. In a monoteistic god, in a pantheon, in science, in yourself, it doesn't matter what you believe in as long as you believe in it. If you believe that no entity can harm you because your guardian angel is always there protecting you or because they are just things of your imagination, then they can't harm you. No matter how scary or powerful they seem. But any cracks in your confidence and, well... I'm pretty sure you can guess what happens then.

    Have a tarot deck around. Check it constantly. Although I disagree with the idea that it can tell the future, the tarot is a very useful tool for magicians. It can tell you more about yourself and the situation at hand as well as warn you of potential dangers. I won't teach you how to interpret the cards, because that would kinda defeat the point of the Royal Road, but I will tell you about some important cards:

    Death: This card means the end of a cycle. Sometimes it's death, but more often than not it is simply a passage.

    Tower: A harsh trial. Something bad will happen and things will come crashing down on your head, but if the foundations of your tower are strong, you will survive and grow stronger from these trials.

    Lovers: A choice. Sometimes it'll be easy, sometimes it'll be hard. Sometimes you won't even realize you are having to choose something, but the choice will still be there.

    Five of Pentacles: An even harsher trial than the Tower. You are in a very bad situation. There is still a way out, but you will not get out unscathed.

    Ten of Swords: If you draw this card, I'm so, so sorry for you. It's the most grim and ominous card in the whole deck. It means almost complete ruin.

    If you are sure that you are only using the Major Arcanas but still drew a minor arcana, the deck is warning you of something very important. If it's the Ten of Swords... RUN AND DON'T STOP. Same goes for if you draw two of the same card in sequence while using only one deck.

There is a lot more to say in general and about specific games, but the post is getting too long, so I'll be wrapping this up after another thing, but please do comment with the questions that you have and I'll answer to the best of my ability!

Now, to finish:

    IF EVERYTHING ELSE FAILS: A wise brazilian mage once said (in a rough translation): "Brazilian mages always pride themselves on being able to handle everything by themselves... until they meet something that they can't send back, then they call their Umbandist friend."

The people who work with syncretic religions (and yes, that includes voodoo and spiritism) know how to deal with spirits, or at least, who to call to deal with them. If you know someone who practices or believes in these religions, call for their help. Sacerdots of other religions like priests and bihkkhus can also be a huge help.

    IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO MIGHT HELP YOU TO SEND SOMETHING THAT YOU CALLED BACK OR THEY FAIL, CALL UPON EXU. If no one else can solve the problem, Exu (and a few other spirits) can. Normally you need a lengthy, complicated, extensive and time consuming ritual to call upon one of them, but if you are desperate, try pleading for their help. They might listen.

It's important to note that every service has a price, though. This is no different. And you really don't want to anger one of these spirits.

I hope that I've been of help to someone and look forward to answer any questions you might have! Thank you for reading!

Hello, first of all thank you kindly for sharing your concern & knowledge with this community. I do have a few rather long-winded questions for you, I apologize for the length.

☆

    What are your thoughts regarding people who use rituals - not necessarily limited to the ones listed here - to inflict harm on others? Does the negativity backfire onto them in a karmatic/"three fold rule" manner? Is there anything that can/should be done to protect yourself, or is believing you are safe & protected (your point about faith) enough to ward off these spiritual attacks? The individual who threatened me, & more importantly those I love, with spiritual "warfare" was morally bankrupt, hedonistic, soulless & of low intelligence with no experience practicing faith of any kind whatsoever - thus it didn't concern me. However, it did make me curious in general terms how powerful someone's obsessive hatred, cruelty & dedication to inflicting harm - justified or not - can be & whether it could potentially manifest something serious, despite the incompetence level of the person attempting it.

    Are there ways to make amends with the spiritual world in a meaningful way? It was never my intention to provoke or disrespect in any way, but I was completely captivated by the occult as a naive teenager (12-16yrs) &, despite agreeing with your point that powerful entities have bigger things going on than toying with humans, in retrospect I worry a friend & I went about our fixation with spiritualism (Ouija boards, Tarot cards, white magic spells, automatic writing, offerings to Pagan Goddesses, etc.) in a less than mature & courteous manner. I've since attempted to make up for my childishness with sincerity & responsibility, but would greatly appreciate your thoughts.

    Someone close to me was afflicted by something extremely sinister in the past, something I genuinely did not believe existed until I personally witnessed it of sound mind & body. I won't go into his private details here (feel free to PM me), but he has since been freed after a long & excruciating process. I'm strongly committed to keeping him safe from harm permanently. Clearly I'd never let him do a ritual of any kind, but are things like lucid dreaming or meditation (e.g. Doorway To The Mind) safe for someone who's survived a serious attack? He attempted meditation once since he's been healthy & it was an extremely traumatic experience that he isn't sure he should ever repeat. How do I best keep him safe? Will he be at high risk his whole life?

☆

To summarize, my top priority is protecting my loved ones from any spiritual harm or negativity, & a personal goal is forming a positive, healthy relationship with my spirituality.

Thank you in advance for your time & wisdom, I look forward to reading any & all contributions you make in the future.

    Well, my opinion on using the supernatural to hurt others is the same as my opinion on using anything to hurt others: please don't. When the person is evil (I hesitate to use this, but I can't think of a better term to describe it at the moment) enough to do something like this, I'm pretty sure that yes, they will be hurt too. If it's karma, an excess of negativity or simply because of their toxic personality, I do not claim to know. It could also be that life is a spinning wheel of suffering and happiness and the person simply is in the 'suffering' half for the moment. In short: I don't know for sure, but I believe that yes, the negativity will backfire on them.

As for how to protect yourself: Amulets and protection rituals work, but it is all because of the faith you put into them, so in the end it all comes back to faith. The interesting part is that even if you understand that, it still works. My theory is that it is because these things draw on your subconscious and it is much stronger than your conscience will ever be, at least for things like this.

There are many rituals of protection. A brazillian one, for example, is to cover yourself in coarse salt. Amulets of all kinds also exist. I personally like the Eye of Horus, but if you are catholic, a simple crucifix will probably work.

The answer to the last part of this question is: yes. Even if they are incompetent, their hatred, cruelty and other negative feelings can attract something nasty. Most of the time it won't be a big fish, but there are always those unlucky enough to draw the attention of something big.

2) To apologize to the spiritual world as a whole? No. But you can apologize to the entities you offended. I'd recommend a symbolic sacrifice: hide an object you like with an apologetic note for the entity and never touch it again or burn some food and/or drink (The people from Umbanda leave it on streets and crossroads, so you could also do that instead of burning, if you want) while calling the entity name and apologizing.

But you must keep in mind that most entities are very, very old. Some do hold grudges for a long time, but most have transcended that need. Their sense of morality is also different from ours, so what you consider as an offense might not be the same for them.

3) It's complicated. The problem with digging into your mind is that you might dig up things best left buried. This is especially true for victims of abuse and/or trauma. These looks into yourself are very introspective and might bring to light again painful memories. But they can also help a victim to find peace. Since your friend has attempted meditation and it was traumatic, I'd say that he shouldn't try lucid dreaming and meditation again.

Now, he will not suffer physical harm from these things, but psychological damage is as dangerous, if not more, than physical.

The best way to keep him safe is... hard to tell. He shouldn't be in any more danger than any other person, so keeping him away from these things should be enough.

As for risk... It's difficult to say without knowing more. What I can tell you for sure is that he doesn't have a target painted on his back. He isn't any more likely to be targeted than anyone else.

However, there are entities out there that target a single person (or a bloodline) their whole life. If he suffered an attack from one of these, then yes, he will be at risk his whole life.

I hope I've been of help.

Hi! Thanks for the informative guide! Some very awesome info here. I was just wondering about keeping a tarot deck close at hand. Is this for when you're doing the ritual, about to do it, or contemplating on doing one? Or would it be just for general use? Thanks!

In short, you should consult the tarot whenever you want. But do keep in mind that tarot is a good tool, but a bad master. It can help you make decisions, but you shouldn't guide yourself solely by it or become 'addicted' to it.

I'm very glad I took your advice to consult a Tarot deck before doing anything. I got a really really energetically powerful reading so I know now that if I go through with this, shit is going to hit the fan super hard. I read it using several different spreads as well.

I won't go into specific details but for those of you interested here's some of the cards I drew:

-The Five of Pentacles (This was my outcome)

-The Five of Swords

-The Five of Cups

-The Magician Reversed

-Judgement Reversed

And the two main opposing forces behind it were:

-The Ten of Pentacles Reversed

-The Wheel of Fortune

So yeah. My gut instincts that there's some bad mojo going on were probably right.

In short? In whatever you want. Yourself, because you are too strong to have your will broken by a simple spirit (Most mages use this one. That's why we sometimes are arrogant), on science, because these things don't exist. They are at most hallucinations and hallucinations can't harm you. You can believe in the rituals, which is somewhat easier because we are already inclined to believe that a formula will work. And many other things.

I can't tell you on what you should believe, that must come from yourself.

I hope I've been of help.

Are the rituals safeguards mostly copy/paste from one anotger and could be changed as long as mostly basic rules are respected? Egh respect for the entity, you rule your home, etc. Mainly asking that these 'safeguaurds' are precise to make you have faith that they work thus they work?

For example, let's say I want to play the midnight man, can I simply invite him over with an offering of food, tell him firmly what rules I set down for the game and that when I say it's over, it's over? Though as I ask this I realise it just might not be 'fun' for him in this case. I have no intention of playing the game, no worries.

In short, yes and yes. Though in this case the entity probably wouldn't accept your rules and wouldn't show up.

Shield I would use when I was young against undesirable entities - protect yourself against attacks and haunts. You can do it when you're older, too. 1 player.

Shield I would use when I was young against undesirable entities.
Approved Rituals

I've been reading through a lot if posts here on three kings and it's really some interesting stuff!
Don't know if this can be called a ritual but it certainly wored for me and does not require any preparations or materials whatsoever. I would use it to protect myself against attacks and haunts when I would dabble in things I would have no business meddling in. Me being me, I would do so with the subtlety of a brick so I got in trouble a lot.

Without further ado: With a clear mind repeat,: -I know if you're scared out of your wits, having a clear mind can be difficult, but if you repeat what I will write here as a mantra, it will help to calm you down- "I create upon and around myself a magnetic yellow shield which will protect me against harmful spiritual energy as well as my own spiritual energy. So it shall be, So it shall be, So it is." The exact wording is not as important as tge message you convey. It is meant to protect you against outside influences as well as block any projections coming from your own, sometimes overactive mind.

As you repeat the 'mantra', visualize your body being surrounded by a yellow 'force field' as it were. You may repeat as much as you feel is necessary. The belief that this force field is active is what A:ties it to your mind, body and soul; and B: brings it forth to existence and makes it work.

To spirits, it is comparable to a physical barrier. They cannot pass through it and touching it repels (but does not hurt) them, like trying to have to magnets of the same polarity touch each other.

In my personal experience, I would tie these 'shields' to my emotions. I put yellow here as it is the colour of calmness and serenity. In my personal experience, i found that spirits and haunts were attracted more by ambient emotions than anything else. If I was mad, I would attract angry spirits that would feed off my anger. This shield would force me to be calm and thus give off an aura of serenety on which the spirit would feed and in turn become serene itself.

Anyway, hope this helps!

It seems it works similar to mirror ward.

Which a Mirror Ward would well. Put up a ward around you that acts as a mirror. You are protected entirely. But a spirit may see themselves in the ward, so while it gives you protection, it also gives more activity, as spirits may be more attracted to you, out of curiosity.

I dont know how real this ward is, we cant specifically tell that it is a mirror. But i use a ward like it and activity always seems to boost after putting up this ward.

So its great if you want to be protected and get more activity

Protection Ritual - protect yourself from bad luck and give yourself some spiritual protection. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/Serpenteir

The Protection Ritual[RECIPE]
Approved Rituals

This ritual was performed on me when I was born, It's pretty much how I survived being run over by a car going 60 MPH, and falling off of the second story of a house with no broken bones.

Basically, this is a ritual to cleanse yourself of any "bad" luck, and give yourself some "spiritual protection"

Things you'll need:

A Knife: Preferably a knife, But almost anything will do as long as it can cut.

Red string: Use this to wrap the knife, and the entity you are sacrificing

A Tabletop: Anything you can lay things on.

A Token of Sacrifice: Anything that bleeds, really, I'd use a chicken that is pretty useless, inedible, and about to be put down, Or, you can use a stuffed animal, cut it open, drop some of your blood in it, and then sow it up with the red string.

A Glass: You need this for the ritual.

Water: The universal solvent

Your preferred drink: Per say, Coke, Coffee, Whiskey, Vodka, Etc.

Salt: Small amount.

Mint Leaves: Again, for the ritual.

and last but not least, Balls: In this ritual, you'll have to do a various amount of things that'll make anyone question doing this twice (No you won't be whacking off your fingers)

Now, for the ritual itself.

Preparation: Don't do the ritual while following this. This is just the setup.

The first thing you want to do, is Grab your knife, and wrap the base of the blade in red string, Then, wrap the handle with the string.

Next, You tie the neck/foot of whatever you're sacrificing, Or, you can cut open a stuffed animal, drop some of your blood into it, and then sow it up with the red string.

DO NOT Use someone else's blood. If the demon you're pleading for safety finds out you tricked him, You'll be cursed. Probably have a lot of accidents, and bad luck.

The next thing you want to do is pour water into the glass you've brought. Pour a small amount of salt in it, then drop some mint leaves in it.

You'll want to place the water to the right of the table, and the blade to the left, with the sacrificial subject in the middle.

Now, you've gotten everything set up.

To perform the ritual, you'll want to say

"With the blood of mine, and the blood of an inferior, I beg for protection"

You'll then want to prick your finger and drop at least one drop of blood into the water. The more the merrier.

You'll want to do yours first, because that's symbolizing that you're the one of higher class.

Let the blood sink in for three or four seconds, then go to the thing you're sacrificing.

If you're doing a bird, Cut off the head, collect a few drops of it's blood with the finger you pricked, just dip it in the blood.

If you're doing the stuffed animal, Then cut the red string and say "For peace, I justify, My blood is spilled twice"

then, you take the glass of water, with the mint, salt, and blood in it.

Then, you drink it. All of it. (Don't swallow the mint leaves, it's common fucking sense)

Simple as that. But there is another thing you have to do.

Burn the blade, the string, and the stuffed animal/thing you sacrificed.

You don't have to turn it into ashes.

just blacken the blade, burn the string on the handle, and base of the blade, burn the stuffed animal, just a bit, light it's head on fire for like 7 seconds, then blow it out. If it was a living thing you sacrificed, then hold the fire on it's skin/fur/feathers for 7 seconds.

After you clean up your area, as in: Throwing away the stuffed animal/thing you sacrificed, tossing away the string, cleaning the cup, and cleaning the blade.

Go on about your day, pretty simple, you won't be chased by some 7 headed demon named "jahdhjksasthmor", or have extremely shit luck (Unless you used someone else's blood), or feel something strong resonating from inside!!!11

You'll have protection until you die, essentially.

Also, just because you're protected, doesn't mean "Go run in the middle of a highway with no clothes, with your feet tied together, with a C4 tied to your chest"

You'll just be protected from accidents that aren't guaranteed DEATH.

Like, being hit by a car.

I'm just saying, it's a bad idea to jump in front of cars

QUICK EDIT: Your favorite drink is there just in case you need something to wash down the drink with

Hello again! I knew I'd seen you somewhere before, and I realized that I'd just replied to your message on another post here, and that I'd read two recipies you had posted here. I agree with you, rituals that involve blood are a big no-no, but then again, all rituals here are a no-no for me. Blood magic is creepy, though. So are rituals with your full name involved in it. This ritual reminds me of the staircase ritual, it has elements of the staircase ritual in it.

Hiya! We do keep bumping into eachother quite a bit :D

Well, I'd say that the doors to the mind are perfectly safe to do for the reasons I outlined in my previous post about it. However, there's always going to be people that keep pushing the envelope to get just a bit of danger into their lives. I've seen recipes with using your name with blood and on a pentagram that wasn't properly researched. I still to this day don't hope anyone actually went along with that ritual, brrr!

    If you decide to not cut your finger and not use your own blood, you'll be having a bad time ahead. (Not like, a 18 wheeler will hit a rock and fly into your 2nd floor room, just, shit like breakups, bad luck, addictions, etc, all the shit that comes from drugs.)

    Kill a living animal, or cut your finger again

Dry Bones - hide and seek. 1 player. 1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted byu/yomomma56
8 years ago
Figured I would post a ritual I discovered since they seem to be popular here. "Dry Bones"

This is called the "Dry Bones" ritual.

Before I continue, please note that this is for entertainment purposes only, and I STRONGLY recommend that no-one try this. If you do decide to go against my word and do it anyway, I only ask that you follow all of the rules, and don't blame me for what may happen to you.

SUPPLIES: Bathroom w/ mirror, and a box of matches

Step 1: Wait until 12:01 AM. Not a minute later (or earlier) to begin the ritual

Step 2: Close all doors in your house firmly. Make SURE that they are secure. Close all pantries, cupboards, and cabinets, too. Basically, anything that can open

Step 3: This one is crucial. Turn off all of your lights. Computers, and phones are okay, just make sure they aren't too bright.

Step 4: Go to your bathroom, and look in the mirror. Close your eyes and make sure everything is completely silent. If you hear anything, get out of the house Immediately. That means he is already here. Think of something that you want. This will be your prize if you win.

Step 5: Light a match and wait until it burns out on its own (Do not blow it out. It will anger him). If the match lasts at least 15 seconds, you are ready to begin.

Step 6: Lie on the ground and say the following words: "I am aware of your presence, and I welcome you into my home. Come now"

Step 7: Go into the largest room of your house, and wait.

Step 8: How long this takes will vary immensely. For some, it will take hours, and for some, minutes. You need to be patient.

Step 9: When he is ready, you will hear a faint moaning sound. If you hear anything else, get the hell out of there.

Step 10: This is where the fun begins. He will try to find you, and you must hide. Be quiet, and don't make any quick movements, as it could give away your location. Think of it as hardcore hide and seek.

Step 11: you must remain hidden until 3:00 AM. At this time, it is safe to come out. Go, again to the largest room in your house, and say the following: "Thank you for playing, but you must leave now. You are no longer welcome". You will hear a groan, and you may now continue on with your life as you normally would. The next morning when you wake up, your prize will be outside the door to your house. Congratulations! You won.

Once again, I must warn you that I do not know what happens if you lose, but I can assure you that it will not be good. Play at your own risk.

EDIT: A lot of people are asking about pets. I'm not entirely sure if they would screw with the game, but as a precaution, I wouldn't try this with pets in the house. Also, somone asked about normal house sounds (pipes creaking, that kind of stuff). That would be okay, just as long as you know what made the sound and you're sure about it.

I'm tempted to try this. What happens if it finds you? What will it do if you don't leave your home when you hear something else? When will I be allowed to return to my home if I leave? What if there is someone else in the house? Anything about pets being there also?

I'm wondering this too. There's too many possibilities that could factor into screwing up the game. Like what if you hear something random, like your cat. Do you have to run out of there? I mean... Houses make noises too. Because of pipes. You can't know for sure...

I'm late finding this, but a couple questions. How much time do I have to find a hiding place? And let's say he moans at, I dunno, 1:00 AM, and then I go hide. It seems like no matter how good my hiding place is, he'd be able to find me in a two hour period. Also, if I were to wish for an animal as my prize, would it magically stay on my porch until morning or would it run away like a normal animal?

The Witch's Window - an ancient summoning ritual to contact spirits of the dead. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/LemoLuke
9 years ago
[RECIPE] The Witch's Window
Approved Rituals

The Witch's Window

The Witch's Window is one of the oldest summoning rituals in the world, with variations of the practice appearing in records dating back to the ancient Egyptians. Its legacy is still felt today in techniques such as Scrying, and myths such as Bloody Mary.

The true purpose of the ritual is to make contact with the spirits the dead, whether to seek information, or to merely communicate with the souls of deceased loved ones. The technique, while relatively simple, can be highly dangerous, both mentally and physically. During the late 19th Century, the technique became popular among various self-proclaimed (and often fraudulent) 'Mediums', who used the ritual in their parlour shows to trick their paying guests using a number of basic lighting tricks and the power of suggestion. However, a story tells that at one of these seances, a Medium who went by the stage name 'Azarian', supposedly performed the Witch's Window technique, with tragic consequences. It will never be known what happened that night, but 'Azarian', who, until that point had no history of mental illness, murdered the five guests who were visiting him with a shard of the broken mirror, before slitting his own wrists. What made the event even more bizarre is that none of the victims appeared to have put up a struggle, or even attempted to leave their seats, despite the fact 'Azarian' had apparently walked around the room, and stabbed each guest a number of times in the chest. Instead, each guest was found still staring at the broken mirror with lifeless eyes, and a look of abject horror etched into their faces.

The ritual begins by standing a small mirror onto a table in the corner of the room. Place two candles on either side of the mirror. Draw a circle of salt around the mirror and the candles, MAKE SURE THE CIRCLE IS NEVER BROKEN THROUGHOUT THE RITUAL! This is important as to ensure that, once the window is open, that nothing passes through. Next place a chair directly in front of the table, with the back of it facing the mirror. The back of the chair must be beyond arms reach from the mirror. Again, this is a safety precaution. Now, make the room as dark as possible, switching out any and all lights, and put up a second set of curtains if necessary.

The ritual can begin.

Start by lighting both candles. Next, kneel down in front of the mirror, and in your mind, try to picture an endless corridor, stretching out into infinity behind the glass. When you have this image firmly in your mind, knock on the mirror nine times, as if knocking on a door. If you are trying to contact a relative or loved one, then try and picture their face while knocking on the mirror. Now, quietly, but as quick as you can, make your way away from the table and sit on the chair, facing away from the mirror. During this time, you may feel that something is coming, or even see in your minds eye, a figure beginning to travel down the corridor, towards the mirror, this is common, and you must remain calm, but make sure that at absolutely no point, from you sitting at the chair, until the end of the ritual, do you look at the mirror!

I cannot stress this enough, do not, no matter what you feel or hear, even if you are certain that you are in contact with a loved one...

DO NOT LOOK AT THE MIRROR UNTIL THE RITUAL IS OVER AND THE WITCH'S WINDOW IS CLOSED!!

Wait silently for the next thirty seconds, as this will allow any spirits time to reach the window. When the time has passed, you are free to begin asking questions to whoever may have answered. The responses make take a number of forms depending on the strength of the spirit, ranging from taps and the flickering of the candles, to hearing voices, either in your mind, or actually from the mirror. Whatever form the responses take, if any, remember to remain calm, and avoid, at all costs, looking at the mirror.

During the ritual, there are a number of precautions that must be taken:

    Ensure the circle of salt is complete, and not broken in any way.

    Do NOT attempt to cover the mirror in any way while the window is open. This can make whoever is on the other side very angry.

    Keep a small amount of salt in your right hand at all times. If both candles go out, you must quickly and calmly throw the salt over your left shoulder, towards the mirror, then exit the room, making sure not to go within arms reach of the table or look at the mirror. Wait outside the room for 10 minutes, then knock on the door nine times. If there is no reply, then it is safe to enter the room, and perform the closing ritual.

    If you feel anything grab the back of the chair, or yourself, and try and pull you towards the mirror, IMMEDIATLY END THE RITUAL!

To close the window and end the ritual, you must state out loud that you are going to close the window, before throwing the salt over your shoulder. This will temporarily ward any spirit away, allowing you to approach the mirror, but only for around a minute so you must be quick with this next part. Walk over to the table, and lie the mirror on it's back, with the glass facing the ceiling. Pour salt onto the glass, and picture the corridor fading away. Finally, extinguish both candles, and switch the lights on in the room.

The window should now be closed. Just be warned, if you ever hear knocking or scratching from behind the mirror at any time after the ritual...

Wait? How are you meant to make sure that the salt lines not broken at all durin the ritual if ur backs to it and you can't look towards the mirror?

Is the chair in the salt circle as well? And do you mean to have the mirror leaning up against the table or literally on top of the table?

The Sages of Four: a summoning ritual (x-post from r/nosleep, all credit goes to ContentEnt)
Approved Rituals

I was reading the "Three Kings" post a couple weeks ago and the astounding response it got and knew this subreddit would be the perfect place to share this (I've been looking for a while). '"The Three Kings" does work, however, it is an extremely rudimentary ritual with some missing pieces and additions that wouldn't matter in a regular summoning ritual, i.e. The Sages of Four.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ATTEMPTING THE RITUAL I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE I have had many positive experiences performing this ritual, and some extremely frightening ones. I've had friends who have had brushes with death, and friends who have disappeared for days. This is serious shit.

If you are like me and stupid enough to do this, make sure you have your phone charged and on you at all times and a buddy who will be there to watch your back. Do not do this under the influence of any substance. MATERIALS

-One Candle (preferably a black ritual candle, but it really doesn't matter with a basic 4 Point ritual) Lighter

-A bowl or some sort of open container that is used for eating (MUST be for eating)

-A scoop of dirt, sand, or gravel. Must be natural, and must be from earth. (No, really, earth dirt matters)

-A cup or open container used for drinking (MUST be for drinking)

-A closeable Jar or container. (Must have a removeable lid, like a mason jar)

-A mirror (Just one, must be somewhat large)

-An object made entirely, (or mostly) of silver

-A Chair

-A Compass (or the knowledge of North in relative to you)

-A Fan (not completely necessary)

-A ruler or Yard Stick

-A bottle or container of water

-A book

Like The Three Kings, you need to secure yourself an empty and quiet room. Place the candle in the center of the room and leave it unlit for now. Do you know where north is? With this knowledge, you can pick which direction you want your ritual to face. Each direction has different rewards, different experiences, and different consequences. North generally has more positive outcomes (though at most it's 50/50). East can be a bit tricky and will leave you with burning questions. West might cause you to feel a little depressed and paranoid for a while, but sometimes the trip is well worth it. Do not ever face your ritual south, it's not worth it.

Place your candle in the center of the room. This candle, which represents fire, will be facing north. Place the silver object, which represents the astral plane, 16 inches south of the candle. Place the cup 16 inches south of the silver object and then fill it with the scoop of dirt. This represents the earth. Take the bowl, and place it 16 inches west of your silver object and then fill it with the water. This represents water. Take your closeable jar and place it 16 inches east of your silver object. This represents air.

After your 4 points are set up, pick the direction you want to face and kneel behind your altar facing that direction. Prop the mirror up, and have it face you. The mirror must be exactly 4 feet away from you. Then put the chair to your left, 4 feet away from the ritual object it's closest to. The chair must be upside-down so that none of the 4 legs touch the ground. The book is to be placed to your right, 4 feet from the ritual object it's closest to, be opened to page 48, and placed paper-side-down on the ground. The fan will be to your south, turned on, and 4 feet away from it's closest ritual object. Once you have your altar set, do not light the candle. Close the door, leave the light on, and leave that room. Go to sleep before midnight the night you set this up, but set your alarm for 4 0'clock. This is because the sun should be in the 4th quardant of your sky by then. When you wake up, you absolutely need to make sure there are no indicators of foul play. If your altar has been changed, do not proceed. If any lights are shut off, do not proceed. Open door? Do not proceed. Do not mix up the dirt and water locations. If you put the dirt in the bowl, and the water in the cup, do not proceed. If any of these occur, you need to leave your house for the night for your own safety. Again, I do not recommend anyone try this

To proceed with your ritual, wake up at 4 o'clock, grab your phone and make your way to the room. Turn off the lights, close the door, and light the candle. This next part is difficult. You need one last component for this to work. Your own blood. Just a drop. I refuse to suggest a way to extract it, you shouldn't even be doing this, but that drop of blood needs to go on the silver object in the center. Kneel with the palms of your hands on the floor in the 4 feet of space between the fan and it's closest object, and stare at the silver object. Listen, wait, be patient, and don't lose any sleep. Any visitors you get should be gone by the morning (not always the case with east). What you are summoning aren't necessarily spirits. Check your windows.

Mhhh... Just a question:

In what plane are you positioning yourself?

In the physical world, the elements would be N=Earth, S=Fire, E=Air, W=Water, so you are definitely not there. You are not in the zodiacal level either, the Earth would match, but Water is in the North there.

So, what plane would the setup represent?

I would recommend against doing this at all. Blood magic is not for the newbies. Hell, even those I know that regularly practice magick would never use blood for anything as it represents a direct link to you.

This ritual, if working, is incredibly dangerous to you as a person, nothing good or even remotely beneficial will come of doing this.

The ritual objects are the candle, the cup, the bowl, and the jar. Lets say the chair is going to be in line with the candle. The candle is 16 inches away from the silver. Then that means the chair is 4 feet away from the candle in a straight line.

If I may ask, why do you place water to the East and earth to the South? The way I was taught is water- South and earth- East (with air and Earth being interchangeable for East and West) And where do you put the lid of the jar, does it stay next to the jar or can you leave it in another room?

[RECIPE] Something I Was Taught Growing Up
Approved Rituals

It's pretty simple, but there is a warning I should include before you read on:

Do not, for any reason, assume you are going to summon the right person on the first try. Also, do not assume trying constantly will summon the person you want. If you do not get what you want, scroll to the bottom of this post to see how to get rid of the unwanted guest.

Like I said, it's fairly simple to do:

    On Halloween, once it is dark, grab a candle and in your mind keep the name of the person who passed on as you light the candle.

Note: If you know the person's face it is best to have the face along with the name.

2. Once the candle is lit, put it by a window, but not directly where a breeze can blow it out.

3. Open the window.

This is inviting the spirit to your home. This works on any night, but on Halloween you are most likely to get a result. There is a risk, however, that with doing this on Halloween that you will get an uninvited guest rather than the person you wished to come.

Now, how to get rid of your uninvited guest:

    When it's daylight fill up a large bowl with warm water and place it in the center of a table in the room where you lit the candle.

    Leave the bowl of water there for an hour. Yes, you may go over the time but you cannot do it too early before the hour.

    Grasp the bowl with your left hand and leave your home to your backyard or any place with soil.

    Pour the water into the ground and let it soak into the soil fully.

    Go back inside, get rid of the candle. Doesn't matter how, as long as it is no longer in your home.

Your uninvited guest should be gone now. Don't worry about the person you did want to come, they will know well enough to leave once Halloween is over, or once that evening itself is over if you choose to do this on a day that is not Halloween.

If everything worked correctly and the one you wanted to show up came then you will notice a drop in temperature in rooms where the windows are not open. You will be able to feel them there, often people have said that you will smell the person (cologne, perfume, etc) when they are close to you.

There are tricks to talking to them, though if it is not them you will need to make sure not to talk to them and simply make sure the next day you do the steps to get rid of them.

A steamed mirror will allow them to write. Not always, but sometimes.

You can sit at a table, relaxed, calm, and with a clear mind. No movement, put a piece of paper onto the table and put a writing instrument in the hand you do NOT write with. (If you are right handed use your left hand, if you are left handed use your right hand.)

Calmly ask questions or talk, wait, in time your hand will move. You cannot force it, you must feel as if the motions come naturally to you, as if you are suddenly filled with inspiration and it is working for you. Keep your eyes closed and your body relaxed through the process. It goes by slow but it is very possible.

Ouija boards. Though this is only for those that accept that what you are doing will not only allow your welcomed guest to speak to you, but allow uninvited guests into your home. At times the bowl of water will not work and you may have to take more drastic measures.

Right so have you tried it and do you have any experiences yourself with doing this?

Also who taught you this?

My mom taught me it growing up. Mostly telling me to NOT do it. I used to light candles in my room and I wasn't allowed to do it on Halloween.

As for doing it myself? No, I'm not allowed to. People who are sensitive to things like this aren't supposed to act on it without being very strong willed and mentally stable.

I have anxiety/depression/post traumatic stress disorder. Thus, any 'game' or any other thing I cannot do without a threat to my health.

I would love to try this with my mother's spirit, but I also know better than to fuck around with inviting random characters into my house. I don't want to taint the feeling of my mom's...presence? with the thought that there might be other, more dangerous people around too.

You should be careful with anything you do recipe-wise because they may call it a recipe but it is actually a ritual. Meaning you are taking part in magic.

I understand that. I was raised in a magic-friendly environment (books on various topics everywhere, open-minded parents, attending solstice rituals and "chat nights" with a bunch of local Pagans, blahdy blahdy blah) and that's part of the reason why I'm so loath to consider this. I may not know EXACTLY what will happen, but I've got a pretty good idea, and I know this isn't something to mess around with.

But the thought of having her around for a visit is still a nice one.

Can you do this with other people in the house without them knowing? and what if you forget to get rid of the the next day, can you do it another day? also can they go other places in the house?

    If you do it without them knowing you are breaking a lot of trust. You are basically opening your house up for something to come on in and if they don't know about it you are liable for what happens to them.

    Hope it isn't very sinister or waiting more than one day will lead to needing a stronger method of getting rid of it. Just try not to forget, if you are forgetful, don't do this.

    Yes. You are welcoming them to your home. They can go into every room of the house which is why you are to alert people of what you are doing. If you summon a sinister entity you are risking everyone's well being.

If you lack the authority to invite a person into that house, you probably lack the spiritual authority too. There are much better ways to talk to and interact with spirits without invite a random one wholesale into your home.

One Step Ahead - play hide-and-seek, for stakes. 1 or 2 players.

[RECIPE] One Step Ahead

This is a ritual similar to others you may have heard of, such as Dry Bones or the Midnight Man game, in which the goal is to enter into a competition with a very particular entity which has very high stakes, and you must use your own wits and resourcefulness to come out on top. However, the one you will be playing against here enjoys a fair, challenging game, and is a stickler for the rules, so being in close danger of getting caught will not necessarily spell doom right away— but you'd be foolish to assume that means you're free to relax.

The game calls for one player to initiate it. It is possible to have two, though it is not recommended for reasons to be addressed shortly. It is inadvisable to try with three or more, as the ritual will most likely fail (in the best case scenario). For the purposes of the game, it is recommended that the participants be reasonably physically fit and athletic, as there will be a lot of movement.

This is what you need:

    A reasonably tall building, at least 5 storeys high, that has a single stairwell connecting all the floors together. The more floors the building has, the better. A service stairwell will usually serve this purpose well. If there is no one stairwell that connects all the floors, but all the stairs can be accessed without having to go through other large areas in between climbs, it should be fine. Do note, however, that the stairwell must be completely enclosed by walls; it is possible, though extremely inadvisable, to proceed if the stairwell is outside (such as a fire escape), has many transparent windows overlooking the outside, or has transparent walls. An elevator is optional, but highly recommended. Any building that fits this description can be used, though for your benefit as a player, it is recommended to use a building whose layout you are familiar with. Home buildings for apartment dwellers are optimal.

    A knife or other bladed object. It does not matter what it is, as long as it meets the following conditions: it can be wielded easily with one or two hands, and it is sharp enough to seriously wound someone with a single, forceful stab. Reportedly, the best instrument to use for this ritual is a large pair of old-fashioned shears or hedge clippers.

    A piece of red fabric, large enough to wrap around the entirety of the bladed instrument.

    A timekeeping device— optional, but highly recommended. It must be analogue; a digital device will likely cause the ritual to fail, and if it somehow doesn't, it will lead to complications.

    A wish. It may be for something material or immaterial. Do not go overboard with this; try and make your wish something that feels like an adequate reward for the risk of partaking in this ritual and emerging victorious.

Initiating the ritual:

    Begin after sundown.

    Wrap the bladed instrument in the red fabric. The wrapping does not have to be flawless and total, just enough to make it unmistakably clear that wrapping it so was your intent. Once the instrument has been wrapped, cut off a small piece of the fabric, about the length of your palm, and take it with you.

    Bring the wrapped bladed instrument to the foot of the stairwell's bottom-most floor, the point at which the stairs end. Try to keep it out of the way in case someone comes by before the start of the ritual, but not in a place that's hard to reach.

    Next, head to the opposite end of the stairwell, the highest indoor point. If the stairwell connects to the roof, do not go there, find the highest landing that is still indoors.

    Wait until it is almost midnight. Do not proceed if there is someone else in the stairwell with you; if there is nobody within earshot, it should be fine. If there are people nearby, but they are behind closed doors, it should be fine.

    When it is about to turn midnight, visualise your wish, hold up the piece of fabric you took, and say the following: “I wish to play with you. I offer this to you, your tool to use. Know I do not play in vain, but seek a fitting boon from you for my trouble. If you agree to that condition, and see that all else is in order, then come now, for I am ready for your challenge” After this, repeat “I am ready for your challenge” eleven times, for a total of twelve. Try to time it so that the final repetition happens the moment it turns midnight.

The Game

    If you have done everything correctly so far, the game will begin. The atmosphere around you will suddenly warp and change, and any doors within the building that were previously locked will now be open, enabling you to move around however you wish. The building's interior will appear superficially identical, though it is not the same place you are used to; any people other than yourself or any co-participants will be gone. The only other one within the building's confines will be her, who by now will have shown up at the other end of the building and claimed her gift.

    To win the game, you must continue to move around the building and avoid getting caught by her until 4 AM, which, as you might imagine, is easier said than done. However, keep in mind that she is a stickler for the rules, and will try to make things as fair and interesting as she can manage. Time will pass the same as it does in the normal world, and no elementary laws of physics will be any different. Being mindful of this, stick to the following guidelines to maximise your chances of victory:

    As stated before, the objective of the game is to avoid being caught. What “being caught” constitutes in this case is her finding you and stabbing you once with her blade. Anything short of this will not count as “being caught”. As you might imagine, this means it is possible to encounter her and escape— this possibility makes the game more interesting for her.

    Though it is possible to complete the game without ever running into her, she can move very quickly if she suspects you are not nearby, so you will probably run into her at least once. She doesn't make a whole lot of noise when moving around; you should listen for bare footsteps, faint but rapid breathing, and a very quiet muttering.

    If she catches sight of you, you will know: she will emit a very loud wheeze and groan, and will continue to do so for as long as she is pursuing you. You shouldn't have to worry about mistaking her for one of your neighbours, unless your neighbours consist solely of unusually tall, thin women who have forgotten the meaning of hygiene and have never stood under a single photon of UV radiation.

    If she does find you – RUN. She will chase you for as long as she is reasonably sure she has your scent and the energy to chase it, which might be longer than you'd suspect given that she's not exactly alive. Remember, though, that in order for her to beat you, she MUST stab you once, meaning that if she gets too close or you find yourself cornered, you may make a last-ditch effort to knock her back and make your getaway; it will be considered a valid course of action as long as you don't get stabbed. If you must do this, do not let her appearance fool you: her strength will be matched to yours, and as stated before, she will not get tired.

    Once she is chasing you, the only known way to throw her off the scent is running ahead of her into an empty room and finding a hiding spot, then hoping she passes you by. If you manage to hide from her successfully, she will grow quiet once again and wander off. Do not take this as an invitation to remain hidden, however; as stated previously, she can tell whether you are nearby or not, and while she mostly sticks to checking the rooms and hallways superficially, if she senses you have stayed in the same place for too long she will begin checking potential hiding places. You wouldn't want to be cornered in a place like that, would you?

Being mindful of these guidelines should help in dealing with her directly. However, you should also be aware of some extra information regarding your surroundings while the game is in progress:

    You should NOT do anything that could be considered cheating. This includes:

    Bringing salt/sage/a power object/any sort of protection with you.

    Attempting to leave the building.

    Attempting to communicate with someone on the outside. This is why you do not bring digital devices with you.

    Bringing an additional weapon and trying to attack her.

    Offering her a rigged weapon.

    You might be wondering by now if the world the game takes place in is the sort of 'otherworld' you may have read about in other rituals such as the Elevator Game or the Hooded Man ritual. The answer is twofold – the world of the game is of that nature, but she is very adamant about keeping it in optimal conditions for the game, meaning extraneous spirits or entities are unwelcome. This does not mean that a presence or two might not sneak into a game for a bit if they think they can get away with it, however. Secondly, while the site of the game is 'her' domain, it is also connected to other parts of the spirit world, meaning that if you leave the building, or even take a look outside, you may encounter something you won't be prepared for, and it won't be bound by her rules. For this reason, you should NOT leave the building or attempt to look outside. If you find yourself cornered on the upper floors, you may attempt to avoid her by going out to the roof, but considering how dangerous this is, it should only be a last-ditch effort.

    For a similar reason, avoid going near any windows in any rooms that have them. Be especially careful about this if you suspect she is nearby.

    Do not fall asleep during the game.

    If there is an elevator in the building, you should make good use of it— she will not use it to move between floors or even look inside unless she suspects you are in there. As such, if used wisely, you can outrun her quickly and frequently; if used unwisely, it's a perfect way to get yourself cornered.

Ending the Game

    If you manage to overcome the odds and keep your skin intact by the time 4 AM rolls around, return to the top of the stairwell, hold up your piece of red fabric, and recite the following: “I have now proven the worth of my skills. On your honour and mine, I shall now return whence I came, and lay claim to my quarry.”

    If all is in order, this should bring the game to its end. You will return to your own world. Before long, you should get whatever you wished for; if it was an object, it'll likely get delivered to you by someone who'll be nowhere to be seen after ringing the doorbell.

Extra notes:

    Bringing an extra player into the game with you will result in a tradeoff you may not like: her capabilities within the game will be adjusted to deal with two people, meaning she will be faster, more attentive, and stronger should you have to grapple with her. In order to beat you, she will have to incapacitate the both of you, although this does not mean that one's wounds will be undone if only the other escapes unscathed. Likewise, the potency of the wish you get will be adjusted to accommodate for two people, although how it may be shared —especially if you wish for something immaterial— is unclear.

    If nothing happens once you perform the final stage of the initiation and you are certain you have not been transported to 'her world', you should be relatively safe, as this most likely means your preparations were incomplete, or something you did along the line was unsuitable (e.g. the bladed instrument being too blunt, etc.), meaning she's ignored your request on purpose. However, if you did something strange such as try to cheat, you might feel something off about yourself or the area after this failed attempt. If this happens, it's best to play it safe and perform a cleansing ritual.

    If nothing happens when you attempt to end the game, she might suspect that you have cheated. If this happens, there's not much you can do except wait and see what she will do with you.

Some background:

Though difficult to verify, the rumour is that there was something off about her from the day she was born; some say she tore off and ate the right hand of the doctor who helped deliver her. She appeared ill and deformed, she should have died, but she lived. Growing up, some came to call her a demon, a blemish on the face of the world. Her fate was determined when she attempted to play a different version of the game— one in which she played the same role, and the other participants were alive and unwilling. However, this project of hers failed when one of them managed to catch her off guard and threw her out of a window on one of the upper floors. Since then, she has been conducting her own version of the game, one designed to bring in outsiders with a tempting promise. Though the stakes of this new game are meagre in relation to the one she tried to complete while alive, she is still satisfied in being able to conduct it to her liking.

I couldn't say exactly where, I remember hearing about it circa 2007-8, must have gotten it off the internet somewhere. Never tried it though, even though I have lived in apartment buildings my whole life, I know enough about my neighbours that the idea of having to take a detour through their apartments seems like it'd be the most harrowing part of the experience.

I dunno, the creepiest aspect seems to be that when this entity picks up your scent that it moves faster, and the wheezing noise. Plus it matches your strength, so you'd have to outwit it fighting wise, like doing a wrestling leg trip or the old three stooges poke to the eyes. I'm very curious as to the origin of this, if you're able to find out anything else please lemme know. I'm going to try to do the same cause this is the first I've ever heard of this particular ritual.

Oh? I imagine you mean whatever ritual she was doing when she was killed. I can only imagine there was something she wanted, much like the wish the player of this ritual is after, but who knows what it was. I don't think it's a good idea to try to find out, especially since according to the story, that version of the ritual would involve actual mass murder.

It probably wouldn't be seen as cheating, but of course you have to remember she can sense your general vicinity, so if you just stay there the whole game she'll eventually start checking the hiding spots, and will likely be very thorough about it.

What if she doesn't think of it as a hiding spot. If I was her and I sensed someone I don't think I would check the ceiling. Even if she's thorough, I don't think she would check the ceiling. I'd like to try this game but I'm a pussy so I can't. Lol I would piss myself. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[RECIPE] Hosting A Party

WHAT YOU WILL NEED:

-A small empty room: a closet, pantry, small bathroom, etc, with no windows. The room should be big enough and empty enough for a single person of your size to stand in without touching the walls or door. If the only thing you have to work with has windows, cover them so that no light can come through.

-Three matches

-A method of telling time

-A pen/pencil and some paper

HOW TO PLAY:

This game is best played alone. Your guests may not come if they feel like there's already a crowd.

This game is best played AT NIGHT.

    Turn off all sources of noise: phones, TVs, etc.

    Turn on the light in the room you're using. If it is an unlit room, place a lit candle or a flashlight so that it provides light inside.

    Start at the furthest point at your house from the room and go from room to room calling "I'll be ready soon!"

    When you get to the room, take the paper and write, "You are invited! A gathering, hosted by (your name). Takes place from (time you start - an hour from start time). Bring friends!" Place it on the floor and say into the room, "I'm ready! Come on in!"

    Turn off the light and turn around, facing the dark of your house with the open door at your back. hold the three matches in your hand.

    Wait a few moments in silence then start counting loudly out loud. When you get to ten, strike the first match.

    If it doesn't strike on the first try, drop it and strike the second one. Repeat for the third one if the second doesn't light. If the third doesn't light on the first strike, you have gatecrashers - uninvited guests. Don't turn around or pause to close the door. Run for the nearest light source and turn it on. The party is over.

    If the match lights, hold it until it burns down as far as you can bear.

    Greet your guests. Suggested: Say out loud, "I'm so glad to see you! Thanks for coming!"

    Light the second match. If it doesn't light on the first strike, see 7.

    Repeat 8 for the second match and greet your guest. If the third doesn't strike, see 7.

    Strike the third match. If it lights, say "Now everyone is here!" and count to ten again. If everything was done correctly you should hear or feel something. It's typically just someone saying "thanks" or "thank you" quietly. It may or may not be from behind you.

Great party! Your guests were happy to come. Otherwise, silence, and your safe anyhow. Afterward, it's safe to turn on the lights.

If at any point you turn around or look behind you before turning on the light, refer back to step 7.

EDIT - Numbered the steps and made it easier to understand. Also please note: this will not work with people in your house, however, they can be outside. If anyone is inside of the house your invited guests will not come.

Can you please be more specific about see number 1 since there isn't really a numerical order in your post. Are you saying if the second/third match does not light or if you turn around or look behind you before you turn on the light you should turn on the light?

With that said thank you for the post seams to have potential.

Angels and Demons - summon either guardian angel or its counterpart, your guardian demon. 1 player plus support.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Recipe]

I have not seen this ritual posted, though I apologize if it already has been.

See: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/25pgh7/we_played_an_urban_legend_called_calling_them/

For those of you that did not read that, heres the jest.

People believed that if there is such a thing as a guardian angel, it would have a counterpart. Everyone has at least one demon, following them wherever they go. These fallen entities are in charge of making your life miserable, in charge of all the accidents that are about to happen in your life. The two entities, the light and the fire, stay at your side until the keeper of the purgatory arrives for your soul. They are the ones who will whisper into the keeper’s ear if the soul is worthy of eternal life or eternal punishment. There is a way to summon them, but they cannot meet at the same time, only one will greet you in performing this, and it cannot be predicted.

Rules are simple

    You would only need a match or a candle, and a closet that is big enough for you to fit in.

    you would also want to have a friend or two to watch on you.

    Now, you enter the closet and close it, leaving “only you” inside.

    Light the match or the candle to start the ritual

    The closet must be dark enough, that the only source of light is the match or the candle you’re holding

    Chant : “I know you are here, don’t want you to disappear. But I do have a single plea, may you show yourself to me”

    This is the time where you’ll hear voices after a few chants.

    Keep on chanting.

    You will slowly feel a presence inside the closet with you.

    Someone will blow your light out.

    When you witness this event. DO NOT PANIC. If you panic or show fear, you’ll end up more vulnerable to the demon’s deceptive powers

    You would see many illusions, this would be the work of the devil, trying to kill you.

    Simply knock on the closet door, so your friend could let you out. Warning: doing this game is at your own risk

I would love to see some people experiences before I try this myself!

To summon a god. [Recipe]

So I know how you guys like rituals and stuff, but unlike the famous midnight man, this ritual is actually pagan. It is taken from the Graeco-Egyptian Magical Papyri.

You will need:

Wine

Frankincense

Myrrh

Black thread

This ritual is to summon a god--the text doesn't specify but presumably a lesser one and one of Egyptian or Greek origin. Abstain from meat and fapping and sex for three days. First you must go up to your rooftop with clean clothes and a black bracelet consecrated to Isis (say a prayer) as soon as the sun lowers out of view. Say:" I shall have you as a dear companion, a beneficient god serving me as I may direct quickly with your power, already while I am on earth. Please, please grant me this, oh god!"

Go to bed. Just before your sunrise go to the roof again and burn frankincense. Say the incantation to the smoke as the sun rises until a bird drops a stone from above. Take this and fashion it into a necklace.

Go to the roof again later that day at evening and say the incantation again, this time burning myrrh and wearing the necklace. The god will appear. Do as he says and he will do as you say. Do not constrain the spirit for more than three hours; he will vanish. When you wish to dismiss him, say "Go lord, blessed god, whither you eternally are. As you wish." Then pour a glass of wine for him and leave it out. He will become invisible, but may only truly leave when he wishes.

Yeah I realize this I was gonna try to put something in my post about this, but I didn't want to sound rude or arrogant. But yeah, I am initiated and try to approach rituals like this with sanctity if that makes sense... Obviously I try not to approach it as a teenage bloody mary game.

Tulpa creation - create a thought form. Alternate here 1 player. 1

Summoning/Tulpa Creation

http://altereddimensions.net/2014/the-philip-experiment-1972-toronto-scientific-experiment-conjure-spirit-ghost-poltergeist

First you need to write down and define a character, you can call this being whatever you want the important part is what you allow this being to do. You decide how powerful this being is as it is in effect a thought form or being you are creating. You can in fact all believe that this being can possess the object you're touching for a longer lasting effect. You need at least 4 people that all are open to the paranormal for this to work. You must first dim the lights. You surround and place your hands on the same object forming more or less a circle around it. You then speak to your being and ask it to do things. Do however remember if you decided this being is an evil character do not get it to possess an object or there will be long-lasting negative effects.

You can use this trick for various things including producing guardians for your home like I have. However they will not always be well behaved, so be careful and always remember to remove objects you got your beings to possess if things go awry.

Not sure about that method, but I used to attend mediumship classes and the topic of tulpas came up. I have only ever heard of this working with constant concentration, as is mentioned in this New York Times article. Tulpas are almost always created alone through excessive thought. Most tulpas come into existence because someone is repeatedly thinking about a "perfect person", thinking about a "perfect companion" (such as a large wolf if someone is afraid or a normal dog/cat if someone is lonely), or thinking about something that they fear. Tulpas also usually exist on their own and are not attached to any particular item.

I otherwise agree with you. I can not however confirm whether what is created or summoned is a tulpa or spirit. There is literally no distinction I can make of invisible beings other than action. That does not truly separate spirits from tulpas in my mind, only individuals of either category. You can however get whatever it is to use objects as a home or conduit through this method.

Actually, that's untrue. They can't possess objects. You can impose their being into the object itself, but they cannot actually possess the objects. They are only in an object for as long as you impose them into reality as such.

The only thing they can truly possess is you, and only if you allow them to and if they want to. Sort of like a trust fall exercise, except you're temporarily giving up control of everything you do and say to someone else.

I don't reccommend making a tulpa. They cannot physically harm you but they can mentally ruin you. There's lots of stories out there of tulpa gone wrong.

Just read the one about a screaming, deformed pinkie pie today that gave me chills.

Another Tulpa creation - create a servitor. 1 player.

Other version of the Tulpa Ritual [RECIPE]

This is the other version of the Tulpa ritual. If you dont know what a Tulpa is, its where you make a servant from your mind to serve you in one way or another. This is my way of doing this. Now i call this a Servitor or a Thoughtform, but prefer Servitor. All you need is: •A small notebook •A pen or pencil •Creativity/Imagination •A prick to prick your blood •An open mind. Now that you have all of the ingredients, we can start to create our Frankensteins monster of helpfulness. First you will have to come up with a name for it. DO NOT USE A GENERIC NAME. If you do, anyone can call that name, and your servitor may be bound to them. Choose a name, but a unique name, and make it BACKWARDS to have it more unique and distinct. You now have your name. Now comes the trickiest part. Remember the name but throw it away and write it down somewhere on the notebook, take out the vowels in the name, make the letters all capital, and try to make a shape that is abstract and unique. This is not a one hit thing for first timers. You may write it down 20 times and not get it right. Once you think your done with it, keep it in your head. Focus on the shape. Meditate on it. Id say take a month or two. Once a month or two of meditation has gone by, go to the sink and fill it up with water. Make sure the drain is not open. Prick your finger and let the blood fall until the water turns pure blood red. You can do this when your nose is bleeding too. Its an alternative but it works. Get a paper with the symbol of your servitor on it and douse it in the blood water until you think you can rip it into little pieces that fit into the drain and can go through. Once ya rip it, do not open the drain yet. Say "This signifies our friendship, [Servitor Name]! You are now bound to me by my blood doused in your sigil!" Open the drain and say "Our friendship has transcended into the spirit world! I declare you once again bound to me by blood and your sigil!" You are now done with the main ritual. Turn off all the lights in the house and if you have anyone extra, get them and yourself out. If they ask why, say your taking them to the park to see sights and take in some fresh air. You and company must be out for a minimum of 10 minutes for the Servitor to get used to the home and know of your lifestyle. Once you come back, meditate on the symbol/sigil for one month. Think of what the servitor would look like? Would it be a cat? A human? A dragon? What do you want it to help you with? Etc, etc. Now lets say its been a few months and your meditating on the sigil and not much is going on. Get an item, any item and have that be your servitors vessel. Get a paper with the sigil, Burn it, and put the ashes in the vessel. If you want, put more sigil ashes around your house to increase connectivity and interaction with your servitor. Meditate on the sigil for a month and it should talk to you. If it talks to you before, great! Your doing great, if it didnt, your doing something wrong. Occasionally, your servitor will ask you to feed him, and he will have a favorite item. For someone i know, it was pine needles and he had to sprinkle pine needles throughout the house. Now for feeding. Just pour wine or any alcoholic beverage onto the vessel, wine is most favored. If you do not feed your servitor, he may run loose into the astral world, wreaking havoc. Now, i believe i have touched on everything. I know this one takes a lot of time but it is worth it, since it lasts longer and if you do it for a shorter time it will last less. (I know i posted something along the lines of this but with nothing, it was my mistake) Ask questions in comments if you have any.

Any versions of this gone wrong? Also, that servitor, how can it help with studies? Will it talk to you and help you study? Asking you questions, for example?

Can it help keep other entities at bay, if I live in a haunted house, for example. Can it also help with more... Physical intruders like mugglers and buglars?

Last one, what is its level of intelligence? It's hard to believe that any other worldly creature of greater intelligence would willingly let itself be bound to serve a human.
I'm not being a dick, I'm really just curious.

I forgot to say, if you have a triangle of manifestation, (look it up for newbies) You can use that with an Ouija Board to contact the servitor as well.

The Corner Game - play in a ghost's personal space, and maybe it will play back. 4 players.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted byu/[deleted]5 years ago
[RECIPE] The Corner Game

Hi, I found a recipe to a ritual, and when I tried to search it on this sub, I didn't find anything, so I decided to add it here. Corner Game is a game using a room's four corners. There's a superstition that "If you look at one of the corners of the dark room before you sleep, ghosts will come haunt you." From ages before, there's many myth sayings that corners are very unlucky. Mental images of corners are often dark and gloomy, rather than bright and happy.

Ghosts that crawl around the ceiling use the four corners to come down to the floor, And ghosts that stand in your room also use the corners.

The game requires each of the 4 players to stand in corners and rotate to arouse the ghosts's curiosity, and people report that sometimes the ghost messes around with them and sometimes plays along with them.

You will need: • An empty room without any furniture. • A light source, better if it isn't something small.

How to play:

    The 4 players are to clear out the house (There can't be any other people or pets in the house, if there are any insects, they can prevent the ritual too).

    Except for the room where you're going to play, turn off all the lights.

    Once you enter the selected room, call out your name 3 times.

    Then talk amongst yourselves to decide who will give out signals (if during the game, someone who's not the designated talker speaks, then all might be injured).

    Close the door to the room and turn off the light.

    Each of the 4 people pick 4 corners to stand in, and face the wall.

    The person who's to give out the signal is to say "One, two, three" and then everyone runs over to the next corner.
    (if you accidentally run into an other player, quietly turn on the light and start again after a few seconds.)

    After the signaling person said that, someone will disappear. If someone does disappear, then the signaling person lets others know through a signal.

    Then after muttering your name backwards 3 times, press your back to the wall and turn on the light. (Then the person who disappeared will come back.)

If someone is standing still, then you can assume that it's a ghost who wanted to play along. If the ghost comes, do not talk to it. (It's good to decide on a signal to warn the others that the ghost is here.)

To end:

    If one of the players is standing still in one spot, then assume that it's a ghost and after the signal, go behind the person.

    When all 4 people gather around with their backs to the wall, place your hands on the switch and whisper each's name backwards 3 times, and turn on the switch.

    After the game, open all the doors in order and refresh the room for 1~2 minutes.

Most important things to remember:

    DO NOT say anything if you're not the signaling person. (You only have to say your name 3 times)

    DO NOT bring any spectators that are not playing.

    DO NOT talk to the ghost.

    DO NOT try to pretend a ghost or scare the other players.

    DO NOT use flashlights, candles or other small light sources while running. You have to use light only when somebody disappear, or when somebody run into an other player.

    DO NOT close your eyes instead of facing the wall.

    DO NOT enter the room after you played alone.

    MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW ALL THE RULES DURING THE GAME.

I remember playing a game like this in school! Like, the teacher had us play it. It was called four corners and the kid in the middle closed their eyes and had to call out when we all had to change corners. And then they picked one and whoever was in that corner had to sit back down until there was only one person left. Had I known it was some kind of half-baked ritual, that would have changed a few things. Lol!

Very interesting. Do you know what happens to the person who disappears while they're gone? I might have missed something (just woke up) but how do you tell if someone's disappeared with all the lights off and no one talking? Also, can it be the signaling person who disappears - what happens then? Just want to make sure I understand!

I have read some experiences, and in some of them it said that the person who disappears is in another room in the house, but they have no idea how they got there. The room isn't completely dark, there should be windows in it. The speaker also is the only person that can look around. If the signaling person disappears, I guess if you don't hear any signals in some time, then you have to turn on the light so the speaker will come back..

[Q]/[RECIPE] Has anyone done One Man Chit Chat?

My friend told me about this ritual:

    In the middle of the night, you go to a quiet, empty room (making sure that no one will interrupt you).

    Prepare two chairs faces towards eachother (I'm assuming they need to be close-ish)

    Sit on one of the chairs while leaving the other one empty

    Now you start talking out loud, about literally anything.

    Apparently at some point you'll realise a strong presence sitting in the other chair. Listening.

    There were no more instructions so it's all up to you at this point.

Has anyone ever done this and if you have then can you tell me your experience? Just wondering. I want to attempt it.

No, but it sounds interesting. Try it, op. One of my friends can "see" things, and she's really strict about never having empty chair in a table we occupy, especially at night and in places known to have supernatural phenomena (like, she'd move an empty chair from our table in a restaurant away), she said it invites otherworldly being. So maybe this ritual has a good chance to succeed.

Ask and You Shall Receive - invite a spirit and ask it questions. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[RECIPE] Ask and You Shall Recieve

The idea of this ritual is that if you have questions, why not just ask?

What you'll need

⦁ A piece of blank white paper

⦁ A black ink pen

⦁ A table or desk

⦁ A chair with a back

⦁ A room with one door (make sure it's a closed space, your own bedroom works best)

⦁ A small amount of your own blood

You're going to attempt to contact the spirit world to answer any questions you desperately need answered. If you don't believe in higher beings than yourself, this ritual probably isn't for you. Devotion to higher powers or belief in the wisdom of your ancestors is what makes this ritual strong.

As a safety precaution, you should say words of protection in the room you're using before starting the ritual. Ask for blessings or pray for safety from any evil or malicious spirits as they will also be listening to your request to speak to them.

Everything written and spoken must be done in your first language.

This ritual must be done alone, any other living beings shouldn't enter the room at any time during the ritual.

This ritual must be done in your own home.

Have your table and chair already set up with the paper and pen placed on top of the table before starting.

Upon entering your room, shut the door behind you.

Sit in the chair at your chosen location facing the desk.

You must have 2-5 questions, no more, no less. You must have true desire for these questions to be answered. "Silly" questions or questions that can be deemed as not being serious are disrespectful to spirits and in the end, you'll only be wasting your own time or risking terrorism from an aggressive spirit. Write your questions in black ink along with your full name and date at the top of the paper. Number the questions and make sure to leave spaces between each one. Remember these questions exactly how you have written them since you'll be reciting them later.

Next, place the pen down next to the paper on the side of your dominant hand. If you're ambidextrous, place it on the side of the paper of the hand you used to write. Obtain a small amount of your own blood, it must be fresh, and leave the thumb print of your dominant hand at the bottom of the paper. Don't cover the wound where the blood came from until the ritual is over. This is both a signature to identify yourself and a sacrifice to express your gratitude and willingness to connect with the spirit.

Get up from your chair and push it in. Turn off any lights in your room, this includes flashlights or cellphone light. Natural light from windows are exceptions. Open the door to the room, this is where you ask the spirit to enter. Say the words, "Come in, come in. Welcome to my room. Welcome to my home. I'm ready for you now." Move out of the passage way as you would for a physical person. This will allow the entrance of spirits into your space. You should feel a slight chill on your skin, upon that feeling, close the door. If you don't feel that chill, leave the door open.

Guide the spirit to the desk and pull out the chair for them, make sure it still faces the desk. Ask "would you like to sit down?" and tell them "I have questions I'd like to ask you."

Walk around to the front of the table. Close your eyes and say "You can use my pen. You can use my paper. Please answer me honestly." Do not open your eyes. The spirit's reaction upon being viewed varies from every spirit. It may simply become uneasy and flee or go as far as possessing you. The spirit isn't obligated to follow the ritual if you don't either, after all, you're the one asking for their help. Recite your first question out loud. You may hear the sounds of the spirit writing. After you hear the pen being placed down, ask your next question. Do this until you've asked all of your questions. If you don't hear anything, use your own judgement to determine if your question's been answered and continue.

Tell the spirit "Thank you for answering. That's all I have for you. It's time for you to go." Open your eyes, but don't look at the paper. Guide them from the chair and push it back in. Guide them to the door, open it if it's closed. Say "Thank you for coming. Goodbye, goodbye." The room should feel warmer. Shut the door and turn on the lights. You should find your answers written on the paper. Dispose of the paper within the next hour in any way as long as it's out of your home. If you keep the paper, the spirit who entered your room will take that as you giving them permission to enter again.

Do not tease or disrespect the spirit. This is a good idea for any interactions with spirits as to not anger them and find yourself in harm. If at any time you feel unsafe or find it hard to breathe, exit the room immediately with your paper and pen. Shut the door behind you. On the back of the paper write the words "I'm sorry to bother you. Goodbye. Goodbye." Obtain your blood again, leaving a thumb print on that side as well. Slide the paper under the door and say those words out loud. Don't enter this room again until the next sunrise. Retrieve the paper and burn it as soon as possible. You should also dispose of the paper this way if you find nothing written on it upon completing the ritual. Going against these instructions puts you at the mercy of the spirit you summoned.

It's important to only say the necessary words and your questions and nothing else during the ritual. Any other words will disturb and distract the spirit from the purpose you summoned it for and risks overstepping your boundaries.

As with any summoning, you're inviting spirits into your home that you can't know the intentions of. Any spirit is able to enter your home during this ritual, so be aware of these dangers and perform it at your own risk. Be careful not to ask questions with answers you may not be ready for. The results may be more than you can handle.

And to be clear - this is not automatic handwriting? You expect the spirit to physically move the pen, and do not move the pen yourself?

The Darkness Game - summon a demon. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a game that is quite common in my part of Oklahoma. I call it the Darkness Game though others call it the Summoning Game. I just did this game a week ago and it has completely changed my life, for the worse. I will show how it's done here but I don't recommend anyone of you doing it, even if you think you are ready for the consequences. Trust me, you are not. So a week ago, on Saturday night, I initiated this game. This game requires that you be alone. You can't chicken out and have a friend like with the "Midnight Man" game. You can do this game in a house or a apartment but it has to be at night. The key element here is darkness, any kind of light is a no no. For this experiment, you will need the following items:

    2 Flashlights (one for back-up) with new batteries.

    A piece of colored chalk

    A positive item. An item that instills positivity or happiness inside of you. For religious people, this can be an item like a cross or a holy book. For others, a picture of a loved one can do as well. This object is your only lifeline once you start so choose your item carefully.

    4 candles

    A knife/dagger/wooden stick

    Lighter

    A heavy jacket/coat, you will need it.

I had the following items ready to go and I was doing it in my family's 3 bedroom apartment, I was alone. As soon as night fell, I gathered my items, put on my flashlight, and started putting off all the lights in the house. Darkness is critical!! I made sure I shut the curtains so that no artificial light can come inside the apartment. After the apartment was as dark as possible, I entered the living room and started the summoning process. The goal is to summon a demon. Now, different people have different summoning methods. This is the method that's used by people in my community. Head's up, I don't think this method originated from Oklahoma though this game definitely did. I guess someone researched different summoning methods and then passed on the one that worked. Here's the method: Choose a proper place, clean it so you would feel that this is not an ordinary occasion. Prepare all needed ritual utensils. Place four candles north, east, south, west (could be of any color, although I prefer black ones, but you can have one of each corresponding color) on each quarters of the circle. Altar is in the middle (more or less) of the circle, directed north or any direction you find suitable for that occasion. You can draw the circle using the chalk and split it into 4 quarters but it's not necessary. Make sure you light the candles using the lighter. Draw a pentagram directly south of the circle of candles and very close to the circle using the chalk. Sit on the pentagram. When you are ready, begin north invoking earth energy by calling on earth elemental demon of your choosing, for example Belial. Take deep breaths, relax mentally and physically. Take dagger/stick/finger, point it upwards (at the sky) and draw in front of you a pentagram, visualizing energy lines creating the symbol, reciting at the same time enn: Lirach Tasa Vefa Wehlic, Belial. You can repeat the enn three times. Imagine earth, its energy, feeling, entering the circle, creating it. Then you turn east and invoke air energy by calling upon Lucifer (or any air elemental demon of your choosing). Repeat previous step using Lucifer’s enn: Renich Tasa Uberaca Biasa Icar, Lucifer. Then visualize air energy, its feeling, entering the circle and creating it. Correspondingly you do the same south for fire (Flereous – Ganic Tasa fubin, Flereous.) and west for water (Leviathan – Jedan Tasa hoet naca, Leviathan.). In the center invoke Satan (Tasa reme laris Satan) as fifth element, the spirit, combining and balancing all elements together. You finish the summoning by blowing all the candles until their flames are gone. Using your flashlight, start walking around the house. You don't have to keep on moving but doing so will increase your chances of observing supernatural activity. Make sure you tightly hold on to your positive item, that item makes you immune to the negative suggestions of the demons. The demons can't hurt you physically since they are not of this realm but they can corrupt your mind and bend it to their ways. They can make you a hollowed out husk, a miserable slave to them for the rest of your life. Through your mind, they can attempt to enter our realm. If they succeed in entering, no human is safe. Not one. Going back to the game. For the first 2 hours, I only noticed physical changes. The apartment gradually became colder to the point where it was positively freezing. I started becoming paranoid, every corner, every mass of darkness held some evil creature in my eyes. You have no idea how scary it is to be alone in a pitch dark apartment, especially after you did a demon summoning ritual. Things started becoming worse after midnight. I started hearing knocking, in random places. First, I heard a knock at my front door. Checked through the peep hole, no one there. Then I heard a knock in my bedroom, then my parent's bedroom. When I entered my parent's bedroom, I heard a knocking at the closet. As if someone inside the closet was knocking. Yet again, no one inside the closet when I opened it. I started seeing the demons after 2 AM. It's very difficult to do justice to how scary and horrifying they looked through mere words. Suffice to say, you will be scared out of your wits. The worst part is when they noticed me. They would look at me and smile in the creepiest way possible. I started screaming at that point because they would start coming towards me. I held on to my positive item and tried my best to recreate the positive feelings I felt towards that object. Somehow, that kept me sane. The demons would come right up to my face and even pass through me. Fortunately, the positive item seems to have worked and I didn't get hurt by them, or so I thought at that time. I spent the last 3 hours of the night sitting in my couch. I was still petrified, I could still see the demons. The fear and adrenaline kept me up, there was no risk of me falling asleep. As soon as dawn came, I put all the lights on and washed off the circle and the pentagram. I let out a sigh of relief and thought that was the end of it. Boy, was I wrong. I started feeling off from that day onwards. As if someone was watching me. I haven't seen the demons again but I can hear them whispering in my mind. They tell me to do the nastiest things, things I will not repeat here. My dreams are vivid and terrible. My life has become a mess. I will be meeting both a priest and a demonologist tomorrow. I hope I can get rid of whatever I invited into my house. To whoever is out there who is going to participate in this game despite my experience and my warning, I have 2 suggestions for you:

    Tell someone you know and trust that you are doing this game and make sure they are nearby in case you need help. Preferably, have them waiting outside in their car so they can see if you do something with the curtains or blinds. Let that be the emergency message, if you open the curtains or open the blinds, then your friend better run his ass to your apartment/house and put the lights on. Don't rely on a cellphone.

    Visit a priest/holy man and a supernatural expert the very next day. Don't wait a week like I foolishly did. Ask the holy man for an exorcism of your residence and of yourself.

I wish you luck and I wish myself luck, I hope I can one day go back to living a normal life.

hold up. "Through your mind, they can attempt to enter our realm. If they succeed in entering, no human is safe."

Why would you even think to post this? This is essentially an invitation, were saying to them, "Hey, if you separate me from my power item, I'm helpless and you can invade this realm!" Some idiot come find this thread, think its fake, and do it to prove a point to some friends while ending up screwing the whole PLANET over!

Things not to do at home. I don't even believe in this sort of thing. I believe in the power your mind can have over you. Clearly you've let it get the best of you. You need more than a priest and I hope you can find peace.

The four cardinal directions and the Infernal Names are adapted from the Satanic Bible ritual format, if no one has mentioned it. I think it would be interesting to try it with the original Satanic names.

The pentagram interests me as well. I've mostly seen it used as a seal or barrier for protection, something Satanists don't care much about. It seems like this was an old ritual that was modified over the years, step by step until it became something "evil".

The Alice Game! [RECIPE]

I have heard this ritual around my town a lot but I have never seen it online so I thought that I would share it here so you can try it too! I just finnished playing it now and it was the best one I have ever done so I thought I should share it with you!

NOTE: THIS IS A RITUAL TO SUMMON AN ANGRY SPIRIT! Do not try this if you do not want to risk possible possession, severe haunting, nightmares, or even death. It is not good to provoke the male entity as he will not leave. DO NOT FALL ASLEEP WHILE ALICE IS IN YOUR HOUSE!!!!

Materials: A bathtub A mirror A pair of shoes A piece of paper A red pen or pencil A candle Matches or lighter A cup

Ok so, I have done this once before and it did work it is supper simple. So a little background the ghost you are trying to contact is Alice, she was 18 when she died. She had very dark almost black hair and blue eyes. One night she came home to an empty house, took her shoes off and took a bath. After the bath she went into her room and died. No one knows what happened in her room or who killed her. Some people think the guy she was dating killed her.

In order to perform this ritual you must be home alone and you must start at exactly midnight, it doesn't matter how long you take to complete it as long as no enters the house at this time or else the ritual will not work. To start get the piece of paper and write Alice on it and on the other side write your name, fill up the bathtub. Turn off all of the lights in your house then stand outside of your house and wait for midnight (Make sure you have your candle and matches with you!). Once midnight hits open your front door and step inside take off your shoes and place the paper with her name and your name on it on top of the shoes. Then say "Alice, I welcome you in". After you have done that go to the bathroom and get in the bath. Put your head under the water and listen... You should hear small noises under the water. If you don't then Alice is already in your room and you need to hurry. If you do then Alice is still trying to find your room and you can take your time. Once you have finished in the bath take the cup and fill it with bath water and go to your mirror. Draw and X over the mirror then say "Alice wants me to run, Alice wants me to hide, Alice wants me to play her game." three times then leave the bathroom and straight to your room and say "Alice I am playing your game now". After you say that run!! Do not look back into your room or the bathroom until you have ended the game. You must now get back to the piece of paper however Alice will do what ever it takes to stop you. As you go back the place that you left the paper if you see a figure at anytime while going back stop and light your candle and say "Alice he's here, HIDE!" then cover your eyes, count to ten then blow out the candle. Once you get back to the paper pick it up and say "Alice, You lost." and rip up the paper, open the door and throw the pieces of paper outside. Turn on all of the lights in your house but keep the candle and matches with you, if you see anything while turning on then light immediatly light the candle and say "Alice, you lost. Go home." If you hear a male voice at all during the ritual immediatly stop, turn the lights on, rip up the paper and throw it ouside. It is very bad if you hear him as I have never heard a way to get rid of him. And that is how you summon Alice! Have any of you ever heard of this one too?

The Duke's Wisdom - question a dead Duke. 1 player.

[RECIPE] The Duke's Wisdom

This ritual details the summoning of a certain entity, who, when questioned, may reveal answers you could not find elsewhere. Due to the unique nature of the entities involved, the ritual may be considered as relatively low risk compared to others of a similar nature, though as always, this should not be taken as an invitation to lower one's guard.

Here's what you need:

    A bathroom or washroom with a sink on a countertop and a large mirror directly behind it. If you can somehow produce an arrangement similar to this one in a room other than a bathroom, you can use that. A sink is not required as long as there is a working drain. If the drain is on the floor, you may place the other implements on the floor as well, as long as you can see all of them properly the way the instructions specify.

    Two candles. The steadier and brighter the flame, the better.

    Something to light them with, such as a lighter or a match. For safety reasons, it's best to only bring a single match with you for this purpose.

    A small tub of water. Specific size shouldn't matter as long as it is wide enough to see your face reflected in it and you can lift it easily.

    A black or dark brown hooded cloak or robe similar in appearance to a monk's habit. Material is not important as long as you can pull off the general look; if you have a bathrobe that suits this purpose, you can use that. You can even put something together from bedsheets, towels and such; the important part is that it looks convincing enough in dim lighting, it hides your face reasonably well, and for safety concerns, it will not catch fire very easily.

    A bell. The older it is, the better; it should be a larger bell that can produce a graver sound, such as a cowbell, rather than a little, tinny bell, but still small enough to ring easily with one hand.

    A woman's voice. This is technically optional, but will greatly increase the chances of completing the ritual successfully. If you're a man, you can try mimicking a woman's voice; in either case, although you should try to sound womanly, you should try to make your voice sound moderately deep, nowhere near a falsetto. Alternatively, you can have a female friend record the invocation lines and questions beforehand, and you can play them for the ritual on an analogue device, or a digital one that generates little or no light— just make sure you let her know what her voice is gonna be used for.

The Summoning

    The ritual can be initiated at any time between sundown and sunrise; it is recommended to do it with enough anticipation that you will have time to complete it properly, but not so early that you will have the entire night ahead of you if something goes wrong.

    Go to your chosen room, bringing the rest of the ingredients with you. Make it as dark as possible; cover up any windows, door gaps, etc. Make sure you are alone in the room and will not be interrupted for the duration of the ritual. Also, make sure that the area is silent enough that you can hear any noises coming from within the room.

    Place the tub of water in the centre of whatever surface you've chosen, then place the two candles to the right and left of it, around where your hands would be if you stretched your arms forward to those positions. Place the bell off to the side, close enough to where it would be easy to grab and ring at a moment's notice. Try leaning forward slightly to look directly into the tub; make sure both your face and the candles' flames will be reflected directly on the water's surface, and that you can see both candles and the mirror in your peripheral vision.

    When you are ready to begin, make sure you are dressed in your robe or robe-like garment, with your face as covered up as you can manage without impairing your vision. Recite the following:
    "Duke, duke, duke. Do you not see? There are answers to all questions, and surely someone of your stature must know where to find them. Do you see now, duke? The truth of the matter. Focus now, fast and true, and tell me— tell me what you see."
    When you start reciting the last sentence ("Focus now..."), quickly take your lighter or match and light both candles. Put out the match if it hasn't burned out, then place your hands as close to the candles' flames as you can without burning yourself— the idea here is to make it look like the flames are coming from your hands if you were looking from within the tub. Holding this position, lean forward to look into the water in the tub as you finish the sentence. Speak slower if you must to get the timing right for this.

    IF you hear nothing strange, and see nothing but your own face in the water, the ritual has failed. Do not proceed.

    IF you hear nothing, but see a strange face in the water, DO NOT PROCEED.

    IF you see a silhouette of a face with two perfectly round, bright orbs of white light where its eyes should be, DO NOT PROCEED.

    IF you hear a noise but see a strange woman's face in the water, DO NOT PROCEED.

    IF you hear a faint noise as if of a man wheezing in pain, and see in the water the face of a middle aged man, you may proceed. From this point on, DO NOT look away from the tub until the end of the ritual.

    If you have made it to this point as planned, you have just summoned the Duke. At this point, you may begin asking your questions, though you must formulate them in a very particular way. The Duke originates from a very distant time and place, quite unlike any most people come to know— not only that, but he will be in a state of confusion right after being summoned, so long story short, asking straight questions will lead nowhere fast. You must ask your questions as if you were in the same distant world, with no direct knowledge of our world, interrogating him about whatever you want to know; for example, if you want know what's gonna happen to you tomorrow, the question should be something like "Imagine, in a faraway world known as the Earth, a [description of yourself]— what do you believe will befall this person the next day of their lives?"

    While conducting your interrogation, you must not let the Duke realise who you really are. Do not accidentally reveal your face, or speak in such a way that he realises he is a stranger to you, or that implies you are afraid of him. If he grows suspicious, you may see him extend his hands towards you to try and strangle you. If this happens, quickly grab one or both of the candles and wave them before the tub while being careful not to put them out; the purpose of this is to try and repel him momentarily, and possibly keep up the masquerade. If he has learned beyond a doubt that you are not who you appear to be, you must skip ahead to "ending the ritual".

    While you are interrogating the Duke, you might notice one or two additional presences that you should be able to see reflected in the mirror in your peripheral vision. None, one, or both of them may show up:

    If you notice a taller woman dressed in a modest medieval noblewoman's garb, you should be fine, as she should bear you no ill will.

    If you see a shorter woman dressed in the sort of robes you are trying to emulate (though her face probably won't be hooded), then you must be on your toes; she is the one the Duke truly fears, and the one you have been impersonating this whole time. She is the reason you should abstain from bringing a lighter or more than one match, and if you can see that she in is there with you, you must pay special attention to the candles' flames— if you see them suddenly growing brighter, or feel a sudden increase of warmth in the room, you must skip to "ending the ritual" immediately.

Ending the Ritual

Whether something has gone wrong, or you have asked all the questions you needed answered, the procedure for bringing the ritual to its end is the same: You must take both candles and thrust their topsides into the tub, soaking the wicks and putting them out. Once this is done, you must quickly grab the tub and dump the water down the drain. Additionally, if you must bring the ritual to a swift close because you felt the robed woman's spirit influencing the flames, you should preface this procedure by grabbing the bell and ringing it for a couple seconds. This should distract the spirit, preventing her from doing anything crazy with the flames before you have a chance to put them out.
As an additional detail, if you managed to reach the end of your questions for the Duke without incident, you could do him the courtesy of saying something like "it is done" before bringing the ritual to its end.

Some extra notes:

    The realm these spirits originate from is of more of a mental rather than conventionally spiritual nature. As such, if something goes really wrong during the ritual, such as the Duke grabbing a hold of you or the candles' flames suddenly bursting out of control, you should suddenly find yourself back in the room as it was before you started the ritual, as if the whole thing had been a dream. However, this does not mean you should assume that such an occurrence comes without consequence. Whatever entities you have contact with during this ritual may have a temporary influence on your dreams or waking thoughts; it will be up to your own mental fortitude to deal with the effects of this until it passes.

    Because the ritual involves summoning the Duke's spirit with the memories he had mere moments before his death, his mind will be muddled so that he will have no memory of being summoned or being coerced into sharing his preternatural knowledge, no matter how many times the ritual is performed. However, this does not apply to the spirits of the two women, who will remember each encounter. Because of this, it should be theoretically possible to repeat the ritual, though if either of the women has shown you any ill will during its proceedings, to do so would not be advisable.

I think this one I learned about a bit more recently, from a book a friend lent me if I recall. I probably would've forgotten about it if not for the fact that I started seeing some of the entities it describes in my dreams not long after I read about it; that's what makes it interesting for me, the way they seem to interact with you in a mental or oneiric way rather than the more direct way the entities or spirits from most other rituals tend to.

The Devil game

This is a set of instructions for how to speak with the Devil. Which, as those of you with any sort of brains at all might note, is a patently moronic proposition on the face of it; one likely to culminate in any number of thoroughly unpleasant fates. Honestly, it would probably be smarter to publish your credit card number on Facebook, or take up a career in crocodile-wrestling. But then, that isn’t going to stop you, is it? Not if you’re sincerely interested, at least. Technically, if you do everything just right, there’s a fair chance you’ll walk away scot-free; and that seems to be reason enough for some people to decide that it’s a good idea. Especially if you’re the fate-tempting, thrill-seeking, scare-junkie type. Or the desperate type. Which brings me to a point of clarification I ought to make. This is NOT a manual for making any kind of Faustian bargain – you know, the whole sell-your-soul type of deal. Although if you happened to bring it up in conversation, he certainly wouldn’t be one to refuse. Following through with such a foolhardy bargain, however, would necessitate removing some the protections which you will put in place for your conversation, and I don’t think I need to spell out for you why that would be a BAD idea. If you’re really mathematically impaired enough to want to trade something that will last an infinite number of years for something that might last about 90 (tops), there are plenty of other rituals out there for you to follow. This one, if performed correctly, should only allow the two of you to talk. This, perhaps, begs the question of WHY exactly you would want to speak with the Devil in the first place. (Maybe some of you just like the idea of making small talk with extremely dangerous occult entities, but for the sake of the human race I hope most of you aren’t quite that stupid.) Short answer is – he KNOWS things. Things that some of you may have a deep, vested interest in finding out. I mean, he’s not omniscient or anything – much as he might like to pretend otherwise, he’s not God – but he’s definitely got a supernatural advantage over the kind of knowledge any human would be able to obtain. For example, he probably wouldn’t be able to predict when the next World War will happen, or tell you the cure for cancer… but he could very well be able to predict the winning numbers of tomorrow’s $500 million Powerball drawing, or tell you what deadly, undiagnosed condition might be afflicting one of your loved ones. Of course, the Prince of Darkness doesn’t just go around giving out winning lottery numbers to anybody who asks. And trusting any sort of information obtained from a being commonly described as “the father of all lies” is liable to land you in a worse situation than you were in when you started. However, if you’re really dead set on finding something out, and you’ve exhausted all other options, there IS a way to try to get accurate information out of the guy. You see, like so many of the more urbane villains in popular culture, the Devil has a bit of a penchant for games and gambling. Of course, the reason he likes them so much is that he almost always wins. Unless you happen to be a fiddler named Johnny or are being represented by Daniel Webster, you’re probably going to get your ass handed to you. But, if you’re determined enough to want to face the risks and the long odds, there’s a certain game the two of you could play to try to win the information you need. First things first, though. We’ll start off with a description of the summoning process, then get into the rules of the game, some tips for how to play, and finally, of course, the inevitable litany of arcane shit that might go horribly wrong. In order to contact your conversational partner, you’ll need to go to a church at midnight. It doesn’t matter what kind of church – large or small, old or new, liberal or conservative – just as long as you’re sure it will be empty. The last thing you want is for some preacher to walk in on you while you’re in the middle of this (for the sake of the preacher’s well-being, as much as your own). The process will probably work best if you try it on a new moon, or a full moon, or Friday the 13th, or Halloween… the actual day is less important that the psychological effect it has on you (as long as you don’t try it on Christmas Eve or something stupid like that, you should be fine). The time IS important, though. You don’t have to start or end your ritual at exactly 12:00:00am Greenwich Atomic time or anything, but as a general rule of thumb you ought to show up a bit before midnight and have everything set up by no later than ten or fifteen after. Show up a LOT before midnight if you don’t know how you’re going to get in. Shockingly enough, most Houses of God do tend to lock their doors at night, at least if no one’s there to watch over them (and remember, we want EMPTY, got it?) There are, of course, certain things you need to bring, and certain things you can’t bring. For this ritual, you will NEED: • A full can of salt – you won’t need to use all of it, but it’s always better to have more than you need than to have less. • Seven candles, red or white being preferable. • Something to light the candles with. You would be shocked how often people forget this. Occult ritual or not, they aren’t going to magically light themselves! • A length of red string, rope, yarn, or thread. • A full-length floor or wall mirror. Ideally, you’ll want to find one of these already present in the church (they’re a bit unwieldy to be lugging around with you during a break-in). However, if there really aren’t any there, you’ll have to bring your own. You might also find it useful to bring some markers, pencils, paper, a flashlight, and any sort of tools that might be necessary to secure your entrance into the church. You will NOT be permitted to bring in any electronic or timekeeping devices. THIS INCLUDES all cell phones, smartphones, tablets, E-Readers, mp3 players, PDAs, calculators, wristwatches, pocket watches, kitchen timers, hourglasses, etc, etc, etc. (Seriously, it’s worse than the SAT.) If you’re one of those people that has your smartphone practically wired into your brain, don’t worry – you can bring those things with you to the church as long as you leave them OUTSIDE the room in which you will be doing the ritual. If you brought a flashlight (helpful for finding your way around without attracting unwanted attention), leave that outside too. Also, don’t bring in any sort of religious paraphernalia to protect you, especially if it pertains to the Abrahamic religions. (And yes, if those goth-y black cross earrings you’re wearing are hanging right-side up, they count.) If you have any kind of holy symbols like that with you, the Devil will simply refuse to show up. Don’t worry, you’re not going in totally unprotected. In fact, most of the supplies with you are not for any sort of Devil-summoning ritual, but for your own protection – old superstitions and folk magic remedies to guard oneself from evil. From what I know of it, the effect’s mostly based on the power of belief, so there are probably numerous other objects, artifacts, and procedures that would work just as well. If you’d like to risk being left helpless at the mercy of the Devil in order to test that theory, feel free to experiment! However, for anyone without a psychotic death wish, I’d recommend sticking to the ritual as follows: Once you’re sure you have all the right supplies with you, make your way into the church and find someplace to set up. It can be anywhere from the main sanctuary where services are held, to a Sunday school classroom, to a walk-in supply closet – as long as you have a sufficient amount of open floor space and are certain not to be disturbed. Set up your mirror first – this is where the Devil will appear when you summon him. As such, you mustn’t complete the summoning until you’ve laid down certain wards around it. First, surround the mirror with an unbroken circle of salt. If the mirror is hanging on a wall or door, lay down a semicircle around it instead, making sure that the salt touches the wall at both ends. Then, wrap your red string around the mirror several times. The color red, especially red string, is symbolic of protection in the folklore of many cultures and religions. This is also why red candles are a good idea. Speaking of the candles, set them up around the outside of your circle (or semicircle) of salt, spaced at relatively even intervals. No, you do not have to get out measuring tape and make it exactly perfect, but do at least try to make it look as though it was set up by someone old enough to be trusted with matches. Light the candles in a clockwise fashion, being careful not to disturb the salt – if you break the circle, you’ll have to start all over again. Once all of the candles are lit and burning strongly, your protective wards are complete. You are now ready to proceed to the actual summoning. To do so, you first must get the Devil’s attention and demonstrate your resolve by performing some sort of sacrilegious act in the holy space. Turning a crucifix or cross upside-down is fairly conventional, but it’s not the only option. For example, I know of a kid who once fulfilled this requirement by scribbling obnoxious graffiti all over a painting of Jesus hanging in his Sunday school classroom. (The nice thing about turning a cross upside-down is that once you’ve finished your encounter – assuming you’ve survived it in one piece – you can just flip it right-side-up again and no one’s the wiser… sidestepping the relatively minor but still irritating risk of having your Sunday school turn into a reenactment of the Spanish Inquisition for the next month and a half.) After you’ve finished doing whatever offensive thing you decide on, shut all doors to the room and turn off all of the lights, so that the space is lit only by the candles. Face the mirror and stare deeply into it, concentrating on your desired outcome. There are no incantations, no arcane strings of Latin you have to recite. Just look into the mirror and wish as hard as you can for the Devil to appear there. After a few moments of this, when you feel ready, close your eyes and count to ten. Then open them. If all has gone correctly, you will no longer see your own reflection. You will be looking at the Devil… or at least, looking at the way the Devil has chosen to appear to you. Chances are, he won’t look like your conventional red, horned demon with goat legs and a pitchfork, nor any other sort of terrible apparition. No point in scaring you off now… better to lure you in, make you feel safe. To that end, he generally takes on the appearance of a fairly average, nondescript human being. If anything, he’s prone to vanity and will lean towards the more attractive end of the spectrum. The only really frightening part of him will be his eyes. No matter how hard he tries, he can’t hide the sinister gleam smoldering deep within them, the malevolent amusement and hunger, like the eyes of a spider contemplating a fly struggling in its web. They’re supremely confident, those eyes… confident, and without pity. Don’t look into them too deeply, or you’ll begin to feel helpless and paralyzed with dread, losing your hope and your will to fight. Since you’ll probably be just standing there staring at him in shock for a few moments (having on some level expected for the ritual to fail), he’ll initiate the conversation by asking you what it is you desire from him. If you can gather your wits enough to string together a coherent sentence, you should respond with something like: “I wish to challenge you in a game of question-and-response.” Even if you don’t get the words exactly right, he’ll know what you mean, and he’ll accept your request with a wide, predatory grin of anticipation. He’s been playing this game for a long time, you see, and he’s very good at it. Most humans, on the other hand, are very bad at it. This gives him a chance to, at the very least, thoroughly mess with your mind, and at most… well, we’ll save that for the “litany of shit that could go wrong.” You’ll have to play it very smart to avoid justifying his expectations. The general rules to the game are very simple, with a few caveats that can make things more complicated. He’ll begin by asking you a question (he always initiates the game). It can be anything from a piece of obscure trivia, to a riddle, to an extremely personal inquiry. Don’t worry, you won’t be immediately plunged into Hell if you get the wrong answer or anything like that. As a matter of fact, he won’t even tell you whether you got the answer right or wrong. After you’ve answered his question, you get to ask him one in return. Now, here’s where the consequences of your response come in. If you answered his last question correctly, he will respond to your question as honestly and accurately as he is able. However, if you answered it incorrectly, he is free to lie to you as he sees fit. Perhaps if you’ve asked him something you’re better off not knowing, he’ll tell you the truth about it anyway. More likely, he’ll feed you the most insidious, damaging lie he can come up with. Either way, after he’s responded, he’ll ask you another question, and the process will repeat over and over again until you decide to call it quits. Now, you may be sitting there thinking that it sounds fairly easy to get the information you need… all you have to do is wait for a question you can answer correctly, and then take that opportunity to ask him what you really want to know, ignoring everything else he’s said. Well, it’s not that simple. The Devil will never give you an easy question, one that you can be completely sure of the answer to. He may instead give you questions that you have some vague knowledge of, that you think MAYBE you know the answer to but aren’t really confident… thus forcing you to endlessly second-guess yourself, obsessing over whether or not you can trust the information that he gave you next. Perhaps you’ll think that what he said was a lie, WISH it was a lie, but be eternally consumed by doubt, unable to fully convince yourself that you were wrong. Or perhaps you’ll have to make a huge choice based on the information that he gave you, and be tormented by fear and indecisiveness as you realize that your fate (and perhaps that of others, as well) rests entirely upon whether or not you were able to correctly recall some arcane piece of trivia that you don’t even remember now. (You’ll never remember the exact questions the Devil asked you, by the way; that would make it too easy for you to go back and check on your responses). Or maybe, instead of testing your knowledge, he’ll ask you something personal, something you even lie to yourself about. You’ll answer back to him, thinking you’ve gotten the question correct (“No, I don’t resent my sister”… “Yes, I would turn the money in to the police!”) – but he’ll know better. He’ll know better than you do that you’re lying, and he’ll lie to you in return. And you’ll believe him. You’ll believe him until you are no longer able to deceive yourself, and by then it might be too late… Or maybe… maybe he won’t even give you a chance to get an accurate response at all. Maybe he’ll just ask you endless strings of completely impossible questions, making you more and more frustrated and disheartened as you realize you’ll never be able to force him to tell you the truth. Questions like: “What was the exact height of Mount Everest in centimeters in the year 1666?” Or “What is the air-speed-velocity of an un-laden swallow?” (Although, knowing his sense of humor, if he ever asked the latter he might consider “African or European?” a correct response.) There ARE a couple of ways to short-circuit this particular strategy, however – additional rules and courses of action that make the game more interesting and prevent you from being stonewalled completely. Although in all honesty, he probably wants for you to try one of those options anyway. The first option is to ask him a riddle instead of a question. If you somehow manage to stump him and he answers the riddle wrong or gives up, he’ll be obligated to give you a truthful response to your next question. If he answers the riddle correctly – once again, don’t worry, he won’t pounce on you like a sphinx or drag you into Hell. What WILL happen is that he will get a “pass,” allowing him to lie in response to one question he would otherwise be obligated to answer truthfully. Honestly, if he gets a pass, you might as well just give up and quit the game right there. It’s nearly impossible to determine when he’s telling you the truth under the best of conditions. Adding another layer of complexity by constantly trying to figure out when and if he’s used his pass… it’s about enough to make any normal person’s brain explode. There’s no way. Just forget it. The second option is for you to take a “dare” from him. If you accept it and vow to follow through, then once again he’ll have to answer your next question truthfully. If you choose instead to reject it, he’ll get another “pass.” Now before you freak out and reject that whole idea completely, you should know that he won’t ask you to do anything overly dramatic or unspeakably evil, like blow up a hospital or murder somebody. As a rule of thumb, most dares won’t involve direct loss of life or any major felonies. However, they certainly won’t be easy. Inflicting severe pain on yourself, doing something that terrifies the shit out of you… cutting off a treasured relationship, publicly humiliating yourself or someone you love… all of these things and more, things you might not even be able to imagine, are completely on the table. If you’re willing to go that far, to put yourself in that kind of position… you’ll get your answer. However, if he manages to come up with the one thing you know you simply can’t or won’t do… well, then once again you might as well just quit. One last thing – DON’T think you can just tell him you’re going to do something and then not do it. If you accept a dare and then don’t follow through with it… well, let’s just say there will be consequences. Just suck it up and keep your promise, no matter WHAT it was. Trust me, you’re better off that way. Finally, when you’ve either gotten the information you wanted or given up on it completely, you may end the ritual by simply thanking the Devil for accepting your request, bowing politely at the waist, and bidding him farewell. The surface of the mirror will seem to swim and flicker for a moment, and then you will be looking at your own reflection again. Only when you are absolutely certain that you’re looking into your own two eyes again may you turn away from the mirror, flick the lights back on, and begin dismantling your protections. Now – and this is important – even if you haven’t gotten the information that you wanted, you MUST end the ritual in this manner before 66 minutes have elapsed. Well, I suppose that technically you have 66 minutes and 6 seconds (subtle, right?), but if you’re seriously going to try to cut it that close without any kind of timekeeping device, you’re probably screwed anyway. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that you keep to this time limit. I’ll save the reason behind that for the end, but don’t skip ahead… I’ve still got a few important tips on how to play:

    Be very careful what sort of personal information you give out. Try not to talk about yourself, especially your emotions and problems, any more than absolutely necessary. This guy knows human psychology like the back of his hand, and he WILL get inside of your head. It’s like talking to Hannibal Lecter. Give him enough to work with and, even if you don’t believe a single word he says, he will still find ways to fuck with your mind like nobody’s business. If anything he asks makes you even remotely uncomfortable, do not hesitate to lie through your teeth. There will be plenty of other questions.

    On a similar note, try to keep the game on track and moving briskly. Unstructured interactions of any kind are to be avoided. Chances are that at some point he will try to draw you off on a tangent – discussing something that fascinates you, analyzing a response you’ve given him, or finding some other excuse to speak at length without moving the game forward. This is not only a waste of valuable time but also another excellent opportunity to mess with your mind.

    If you choose to give him a riddle, use one you’ve made up yourself. If your riddle has ever been written down anywhere at all, from the pages of “The Hobbit” to some long-lost tome of ancient magic, he will already know the answer. That said, it still has to be a LEGITIMATE riddle, with an answer that makes logical sense from some angle. You can’t just ask something like “What’s green, has ten legs, and hops?” then claim for some inexplicable reason that the answer was “marshmallows.” Nor can you ask him a straight question like “What have I got in my pocket?” (he probably knows that, anyway). There are no hard-and-fast rules to determine whether a riddle makes sense or not, but you’re a reasonable human being. Your ancestors ate from the Tree of Knowledge. Please, for the love of crap, use common sense.

    If you choose to take a dare, there is a slight chance that the Devil will ask you to do something seemingly easy… deliver a letter, for instance, or scribble a ten-digit number in a public restroom stall. If he does ask you for something like this, and you have even a shred of common decency in you, do NOT accept. Chances are that he’s using you to further some sinister plot, one liable to ruin a lot of lives and harm a lot of people. Who knows, maybe you’re the type of person who really doesn’t mind throwing an unknown number of total strangers under a bus to find out what you want to know… but at least be aware that that IS what you’re doing.

    Last, but not least, be very aware of the time. It might be helpful to do some practicing beforehand and get a feel for how long an hour is without a watch. The Devil will probably put off discussing the things you’re most keen to find out for as long as he can; and as you near the 66 minute deadline, he’ll start trying harder and harder to distract you, captivate you, and otherwise keep you playing until it’s too late. He’ll string you along, feed you little glimmers of false hope, keep you thinking: “Just a few more minutes… I’m almost there!” Don’t fall for it. Don’t go over the time limit. No matter what. Now, you might be thinking that this game really doesn’t sound all that dangerous so far… threats of psychological damage rarely seem to carry the same weight as threats of physical damage, even though their costs are often just as great. Hate to burst your bubble, but the game is FAR from safe. There are plenty of ways for you to seriously screw yourself over both physically and mentally (not to mention spiritually). And it is with these that I will conclude, in the vain hope that they may make some sort of impression… First, while you are speaking with the Devil, do NOT let him out of your sight. Keep staring into the mirror no matter what happens. He will undoubtedly try various tricks to make you look away… You will hear noises behind you, feel eyes on the back of your neck, see shadowy phantoms writhing in the depths of the mirror. A cold breath will blow upon you from behind, smelling like the crypt. A deep silence will settle, only to be interrupted by a loud SMACK directly behind your head, giving you about the worst jump-scare you’ve ever had. Hell, the Devil may even abandon a measure of his own dignified façade and give a sudden jump of feigned shock, shouting loudly and pointing behind you with a very convincing look of terror on his face. Whatever he might test you with, you must not look away from him. If you look away, if you lose sight of him completely – even for one second – you will look back at the mirror to find him gone. Well, not gone. Out of the mirror. In the room. With you. Exactly how much of your body the police will find the next morning, and what state it’s in, will depend entirely on the sort of mood he’s in. The same thing goes if you break any of the protections you laid down before beginning the ritual. Interrupting the circle of salt, letting the red string unwind, knocking over a candle or letting one go out… any of these things will free him from the mirror, and then – well, you’re all a bunch of creative horror junkies. I’m sure you can fill in the blanks. On a different topic, you may reach a point in the game (probably after a long series of maddeningly impossible questions) where the Devil asks you the deceptively simple question “What is your full name?” You MUST NOT give it to him. Names can be things of great power. Although the Devil will, of course, already know your name, telling it to him yourself is akin to inviting a vampire into your home. Your name is deeply synonymous with your own, inner self; thus, giving him your name is powerfully symbolic of giving him your self. If you are foolish enough to make this mistake, all of your protections will be for naught, and he will seize upon your unwitting offer with malicious glee, stealing away your soul and dragging it back with him into Hell. At least this way the police will find a complete, identifiable body. As a matter of fact, your vacant shell will be totally unblemished, seemingly having dropped dead of sheer terror. Last, but certainly not least, there’s the matter of what happens if you go over the time limit. This is arguably the worst thing you can do. You won’t think so at first… the Devil will give you no indication that you have in fact exceeded the time limit and you will conclude the ritual as if nothing had gone wrong. Perhaps, as the Devil’s image in the mirror trembles and gives way, you’ll see a particularly nasty, triumphant smirk flash across his face, but this will be easily dismissed as your imagination. You’ll turn the lights back on, gather your belongings, and go to leave the room. But, when you open the door, you will see… nothing. That’s right, nothing. Just a flat, white void extending infinitely in all directions. Only the room which was reflected in the mirror will now exist. Incidentally, if you turn back around to face the mirror again, you may catch a last glimpse of your own reflection. Perhaps it will even turn and favor you with a smirk and a cheeky wave before sweeping out the door into the perfectly normal church hallway outside. As you may have already figured out, you yourself are no longer in the church. Your soul is now trapped in the mirror, and the Devil has taken the liberty of possessing your body, now that you are no longer using it. Pound on the glass and scream all you like, you’ll never get out on your own, and no exorcist can help you. But don’t worry, it’s not like you’re in Hell, right? At least, not necessarily… What you have to understand, see, is that a human soul stripped bare of its flesh is a deeply volatile and vulnerable thing, especially when trapped in the land of the living. You are now an entity of purely mental properties, and as such, the barriers between what is real to you and what is imaginary have been completely dissolved. As you fill that reflected room with your anger, your sorrow, your fear at being trapped, these emotions will begin to coalesce, given form by your mind. If you’re not particularly imaginative, these creatures may not be too terrible, may not be able to inflict too much horror and pain. With time, you may even be able to teach yourself to get rid of them. If, however, yours is a mind haunted by monsters…a mind that is vibrantly creative and imaginative and more than usually twisted… well, there’s no telling what horrors might come clawing their way out of the maelstrom, tasting sweet release from the confines of your subconscious, hungering for your terror and suffering. They will refuse to be banished, dragging you kicking and screaming into an endless positive feedback loop of pain and fear. Needless to say, if you’re a regular patron of websites like this one, you’re probably pretty well fucked. There’s only one way to find release from the mirror and the world that you’ve created therein. They say that if you call to the Devil once more and ask him to free you from the mirror, he’ll be willing to take you out. For the usual fee, of course. Who knows, maybe if your imagination is twisted and powerful enough to create a personal Hell that leaves you begging for the real thing, those talents might be put to good use. There are over seven billion people in the world, after all; even the Devil himself can’t be messing with all of their minds at once. Talented help is always appreciated. Of course, the corollary to your being trapped inside the mirror is that the Devil now gets to do whatever he wants in your body until sunrise. At around that time, your body will mercifully drop dead from the strain of the possession; autopsy will probably identify the cause as some kind of coronary event. Don’t get too relieved, though, he’s perfectly capable of stirring up plenty of trouble in those few hours. For instance, he may decide to do something big and dramatic, like purchase a large meat cleaver and go on a murder spree, starting with the names in your address book and working his way out to complete strangers if he has time. Or perhaps he’ll focus on only one person, someone who trusts you completely, using your persona to get him or her alone and vulnerable, and then… well, no need to describe it here. Once again, I’m sure you can think of a few things. Starting to see why I called this the worst outcome yet? Of course, there’s also a chance he won’t lay a finger on any of your loved ones, instead deciding to do something a little more subtle… more insidious. Like drop off a few nondescript, unmarked packages on certain doorsteps in the dangerous part of town. Or locate a particular dusty, age-yellowed text in the storeroom of your local library and intentionally misfile it in the Young Adult Literature section. Or whisper seven very choice words into the ear of the distracted-looking young redhead waiting for the 3am subway train. Or maybe he’ll decide that, in this age of waning superstition, not enough people are getting interested in his games, and the knowledge of them is in danger of being lost. Maybe he’ll decide he needs to get the word out a bit more, do a bit of networking, attract some new suckers… ahem, “challengers.” Maybe he’ll take a quick peek at your browser history, see where the impressionable, curious minds are hanging out these days. Maybe he’ll even write a quick tutorial, in modern parlance rather than some inscrutable, obsolete demonological text… post it on the Internet and see how many bites he gets… Haha, maybe I really shouldn’t have gone there. But if you’ve made it this far without shying, a little twist at the end isn’t going to put you off, is it, dear Reader? I’m sure there are plenty of intrepid adventurers among you with burning questions you’d like answered. And you’re all a smart bunch. You know the pitfalls, you know the conventions, you live and breathe this sort of thing, do you not? There’s no way YOU’D fall into any of the obvious traps, right? You’re not some Dick or Jane off the street, after all; you’d be bringing a whole new level of competition. You would…

The only thing I could ever ask the devil is if he is still afraid of that dude named Alan. The one who lives in Northampton. I bet he is.

I'd never do this (I don't even believe in the devil anyway) but this was a nice read! :D

A Deal With The Devil.

Hello everyone. This is a ritual on how to get almost anything you want by making a deal with the devil. I will not lie or deceive you. You will be handing over your soul in exchange for whatever you ask for. So, please be sure of what you are doing before you do it. Again I won’t recommend doing this ritual because eternal damnation is not worth anything but that is just my opinion. Maybe some of you want to see a loved one who has passed away. Maybe you are desperate enough, maybe you are willing to give anything to cure your little twelve year old sister of cancer. Or maybe you just want to get rich and enjoy your sixty or seventy year here for an eternity in hell. Again your reasons are yours and yours alone.

So some you might have heard of supernatural bargains and deals being struck at crossroads. That’s partially true. Throughout many cultures, crossroads are an active site for supernatural activity. In the west, deals with demons and the devils are supposedly stuck here. In Japanese folklore, the fourth road at the fourth cross is symbolic of a way to death or the undead realm. In ancient Arabian lore djinn and ifrits supposedly kept watch with four heads at crossroads. Again, all stories but with a hint of truth. The crossroads is where you will need to go if you want to strike this bargain. Needless to say you will have to be alone. I’m not saying it won’t work because there was an account of two sisters doing it. But it is undesirable and in most cases just doesn’t work. The devil simply refuses to appear because he probably wants you to be alone. You see this deal is only for the desperate and the foolhardy and he doesn’t want his customers being influenced by another person while he’s trying to barter with them. There’s another reason why doing it with two or more people is not desirable. I’ll explain that later with the rules.

The hour must be twilight, around three. Its okay, you don’t have to get exactly there at three greewich mean time but try to make it in a minute or two of that time. It must be a new moon or a crescent. I’m sure you can refer to the internet for lunar phases. Also you must approach from the south direction to the north. Trust me there’s a reason for all the detailed instructions. Go and stand in the middle of the road. Did I mention that you must be preferably alone? So you would do well to not pick a busy road or a crossroads with a bar nearby or something. Again, he doesn’t want other people influencing and trying to save you from making this foolhardy bargain. Think about it, if you want to con someone you want them to believe you and not other people right?

Meeting the devil is a dangerous proposition. Yes, it is as exciting as it is as dangerous and stupid as it sounds. Perhaps even more so. So you will be carrying some things with you. You won’t be going in without any cover, in fact done correctly and he won’t be even able to do so much as touch a single strand of your hair. Done wrong and well...things get a little bit more interesting then. There are three things that you can carry for your protection. They work like protective wards and charms. Again, there have been a record of attempts of people trying them out and these ones seem to work the best for protection. The first thing you need is a bone of a black cat, preferably the hind leg bone but any other bone should work just as fine. You can easily find it at your local occult shop. But I should warn you a little bit. The shop might be a little bit hesitant to sell you the stuff. You see they know what black cat’s bones are used for. Summoning. And by experience they are unwilling to let customers perform it. Oh they don’t care about you or anything. They just don’t want the cops questioning them when one of their customers goes missing unexpectedly.

The second is a bunch of flowers. At least three individual flowers are a must. No, you can’t carry any old flowers from your garden. They must belong to Verbena genus. Also called vervain. I find that verbena californica or the red hills verbena works very well. These flowers throughout history have been powerful protection charms. Maybe that’s why they are called the Devil’s bane sometimes. Again, you can find these at any local occult store. But caution needs to be exercised. The most difficult of the charm to get perhaps is the graveyard dirt. And yes, it must be fresh. So you might need to take a little detour before you head down to the crossroads. Be careful when you are trying to get into a graveyard at night. Not that it would have any supernatural repercussions. Only that the guard at the nightshift duty there might find you or might turn you over to the cops for “gravesite desecration”. Happened to me once. So please, be quiet and be careful. A handful of graveyard dirt should be enough for the ritual. Bring a plastic bag or some sort of container for it because you probably don’t want one hand full of dirt when you are talking to the fallen one, the father of all lies and such.

Also there is another protective talisman that you can carry but I am not sure about this one. It is because of the difficulty of finding it. It is some sort of voodoo powder. Again I am not sure but there have been many cases of it working so it is worth a mention at least. I don’t specifically know which one. If anybody here is proficient in the art of voodoo please feel free to contact me. I would love to talk to you about this. Again there is a plus side to carrying this voodoo powder. With every talisman you carry you get a precisely a minute or so of protection. With every minute of the devils presence one of the talismans will wane in power. So with three of them you get three minutes to make the deal. Carrying the voodoo powder makes it four. So you get one extra minute. But as it might be a little bit out of reach we’re just gonna have to make do with three minutes of his time.

You will have to make sure that none of these charms leave your person/body at any time after you have taken your position in the middle of the crossroads. I don’t think I need to say why. Also you can carry a candle if you feel it is too dark for you to see anything. Also put on a jacket if it’s a windy night. You will not be allowed to carry any electronic device for light or for any other purposes. Again, contact with anyone while you are making the deal is not preferable. By the seller of course.

Once you stand in the centre of the crossroads, close your eyes, take deep breath. Try not to think of anything else. You will need a little bit of concentration for this. There is no Latin chant or archaic string of words that you have to say for him to approach you. No, he already knows why you are there. You see with normal occult summoning the means is to constrict the said entity to do your bidding. Be that may be anything. With normal summoning the core idea is "Appare; Mane; Ausculta; Se Dede; Pare; Redi”. “Appear; Remain; Listen; Submit; Obey; Return.”

But we are not trying to constrict or bend him to our will; oh no we are inviting him to a trade. Think of it as inviting a guest. Would you bind your guest in infernal chains and Latin strings of holy names? Not saying that you could or couldn’t do it. Also we are not summoning any old demon or goblin. No, this is Satan himself we are trying to converse with. So be polite. There are specific rules that you have to follow when you are in his presence. Trust me these are for your own safety. He too is bound to follow the rules of appearing on the mortal plane. The rule being that he cannot physically harm any living being. But the devil doesn’t have a penchant for following rules. That’s why we have the talismans protecting you. You have to be polite. You must not make any offensive gestures or statements. He is your guest. Treat him as such. You must not carry any symbols of religious faiths. No holy crosses, taweets, karas, omamoris, ankhs and such. Again, that is just being disrespectful. Also, under no circumstance are you allowed to touch him. It’s not that you are not allowed, but doing so would have drastic consequences. All you protection would be gone and you would be left alone at his mercy. Don’t be afraid of him either, he cannot harm you. He cannot touch you at all. He is there to offer you a deal. No more, no less.

Close your eyes and concentrate on him appearing to you. A minute or so and he should appear. You might feel a sudden weight or a sudden shift of wind. You won’t see him walking either. He will appear right in front of you as you open your eyes. Also if you feel like you have changed your mind and don’t want to make the deal, no worries. You can cancel it. Just bid him a polite goodbye and tell him that you won’t be making the bargain. You must keep all of the protection charms on you until the next gibbous or full moon.

Don’t worry he won’t come as a red horned and hoofed demon or some sort of grisly, terrible apparition. No. He will come as everything you have hoped for and more. He generally tends to take on the gender of the opposite sex. You know to lure you in, no point in scaring the brave, young you. Suffice to say he will be fairly attractive to you. If you are into muscle guys he will be so, if you’re into cute slim girls he might just appear as a sweet, petite blue-eyed, blond girl. Or maybe you are into the same sex; he might just appear as your fantasy. Again his features will be according to your heart’s desire. He’s just trying to make you to break your protection but again, under no circumstances you are to touch him, no matter how attractive he seems. He will be dressed modestly. There will be no discerning way you will be able to distinguish him from any normal person except the handsome looks of course.

Greet him politely. And he does so too. You have three minutes to state your deal. His price will of course always be your soul but what you have to discuss is the reward. State it very clearly what you want. Want to be healthy for the rest of your life? State if clearly and precisely in a manner that he cannot twist it into something else. Because he will try his hardest to misinterpret anything you say. A pause for breath might be interpreted as a full stop turning your sentence into gobbledegook. You must be very careful with your words. Those of you familiar with the process of invocation know what the cost of mispronouncing a syllable is. Trust me; your words are everything between you and eternal damnation. Break any of the above rules, pass the three minute limit, offend him in any way and he is free to claim what he sees is rightfully his.

Also there are certain things that you can’t ask for and certain things you shouldn’t ask for. You cannot ask for immortality. If your body doesn’t die, how can your soul reach its destination? You understand the en pass. You cannot ask him for anything ridiculous, like lift the earth or move it out of its orbit or something. He will just not take you seriously or might just consider it an offense. Other than that feel free to wish for immeasurable wealth or to make you desirable to all men and women or make you the greatest guitar player in the world, so on. There are no stringent rules but ask for something that is possible in this reality.

The things that shouldn’t ask for are as follows. Don’t ask him about god or any godly event or angelic beings as such. No surprise that he will be not excited hearing about god. Don’t ask him to bring back a loved one from the dead. The souls of those who have passed away are not in his control. He cannot bring them back to life, no matter how much he says that he can. He will bring back a wraith, a cheap and grotesque illusion of your loved one.

Again you might get distraught seeing your loved one burning with their mouths wide open in a perpetual scream as their fresh burns and rots and worms poke out of... Sorry. Understand the implications of what you ask for before you ask it. Also don’t ask him to let you go or something like that. You see, once you make the deal and strike the conversation with him, he might be very reluctant to let go of what he sees as his birth right. Once you have made the deal he will nod and touch your shoulder. A theory is that he is branding your soul as his own. So it’s easier to find you later when the time to collect the payment has come. Don’t worry. He cannot hurt you. Like you he cannot break the agreement. He cannot make you die before your natural time of death. Also after the deal is done, there is no going back. Trust me, the most famous account of the deal might just be Saint Theophilus of Adana. He made a similar deal and repented for his sins, even getting Virgin Mary herself to absolve him of his sin. Didn’t work out for him. Once the contract is made, there is nothing that will revoke it. So plan your afterlife out before you dive into this one. Again I wish you no harm; I am just a scribe, a scholar who has a document of the people that try this ritual. Maybe your name will be added to the future records. Lastly Good luck and May god bless your soul.

    State if clearly and precisely in a manner that he cannot twist it into something else. Because he will try his hardest to misinterpret anything you say.

Pretty interesting. You think it would be possible for someone to do this, then tell him goodbye immediately, just to see if this works? or would Satan just not show if he doesn't think you are truly trying to make a deal

If you get second thoughts on the spot that's one thing, but planning to summon him just to waste his time requires some balls. He'd know and he wouldn't be happy about it.

I mean, it says right there he's not allowed to hurt you. And, he's the Devil after all, if anyone has a sense of humor, or would appreciate some balls, it's the guy who decided to say "Fuck you" to God.

Interesting. One question though. Why is it undesirable for two or more people to do it? Other than "he doesn't want you talking to other people". You said you would "explain it later with the rules" but you didn't do it.

Game of Greed a/k/a Greedy Baron Game - greedy spirit steals your valuables. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Recipe] The Game Of Greed

aka "The Greedy Baron Game"

This was the first time I participated in a ritual, and I was a bit surprised that it wasn't to be found on the internet yet. It was only a few days ago that I was dared into playing this weird game, so I remember the details quite well. This game will summon an entity I call “The Baron”, an allusion to so-called robber barons. All recommendations that apply to other summoning rites also apply here (do not provoke it, do not assume it has left afterwards,…) Note that a dare is just about the only reason I played this game even though it’s relatively safe (notice that word “relatively”), since there is basically no pay-off to winning.

Player(s): 1

Requirements: • 1 large but shallow bowl • Tap water • A small number of valuable trinkets (more on that below) • 2 pillows • 1 pack of candles • Matches or a lighter • 1 opaque bag, pot or other container • Salt • 1 “symbol of scarcity” for each door or room adjacent to your entrance hall. The symbols of scarcity are used to “convince” the entity you are going to summon that you are poor. As such, there is no clear-cut definition as to what these objects should be. Something that is broken or worn seems to work quite well, but it can also be an empty container or the like. I used a tattered dirty towel, an empty purse and a wooden fork (wood is apparently considered a “poor man’s metal”). I recommend using three different items lest the entity sees through the trick.

The rules to the valuable objects though, are more restrictive. These can be gems or objects made of precious metals, but since you probably don’t have many of those lying around and you risk losing them, I think it’s best to just use monetary coins. Their value doesn’t really seem to matter, and you can even use coins that are no longer in currency (such as French francs). Whatever you pick, DO NOT USE JEWELRY. Ever. In fact, keep any pieces of jewelry out of the room (out of the house if at all possible) and make absolutely sure you’re not wearing any yourself. As for the number, make sure you can quickly count them. I wouldn’t use more than 10, but no fewer than 3 either. I used 7 coins because that’s my lucky number. Never use exactly 4 or 13. Notes will not make The Baron appear. Also, this goes without saying but…they have to be valuable in the economical sense of the word. Sentimental value only wastes the Baron’s time, and you don’t want that…

Preparations:

    Make sure the room is deprived of all valuables or all items that might symbolize wealth (fancy vases, golden objects…).

    Begin at night.

    Fill the bowl with tap water and place it on the floor.

    Open all doors leading to the entrance hall of your house (or the first room you enter when opening the front door). This includes the front door.

    Make sure all other doors in the house are closed and that any light source in those rooms is dimmed. Spread out a line of salt in front of each of these doorways.

    Place the symbols of scarcity in the center of all doorways leading to the entrance hall. They must not be moved at any point during the ritual.

    Light a number of candles near the bowl. The number or placement aren’t as important as in some other rituals: it only signals the entity where the game will be taking place. Four candles surrounding the bowl should work well.

    Place the pillows on either side of the bowl, facing each other. If the room has a wall where something that may bring you luck has been positioned (a family photo, a religious symbol, etc.), place one pillow near that wall: that will be your seat. Mind the candles!

    Be seated on one of the pillows. Place the empty container in front of you. Drop the coins in the bowl.

    Wait.

The Main Event:

    The game will begin when you feel a sudden chill and/or see a weak ripple in the water. At this point, abort the ritual if:

        you feel a chill but no ripple follows it

        the candles are blown out

        the symbols of scarcity are moved

        the sensations you are looking for are particularly powerful (for example, the ripples being so powerful they make the water spill) More about aborting the ritual in a later section. If none of this happens, continue to the next and most difficult step.

    Wait until the ripples grow stronger. They should at least reach the edge of the bowl. When this happens, quickly check if all the coins you placed in the bowl are still there. If they are, grab a coin as quickly as you can and place it in the empty container. NEVER take more than one coin at a time. Repeat this process until all the coins are gone. Sounds easy enough? This is where it gets complicated…

The Baron will also try to collect as many coins as possible. I have not experienced this myself, but I’ve been told that you will not see coins floating in the air. Rather, it will seem like they were never there to begin with. It’s hard to explain. One moment you look at the bowl and see 7 coins, then you blink or your attention briefly fades, and the next moment there are only 6 left.

While this is a game and you should always try to win out of respect for your opponent, the best outcomes for you are to either grab all the coins before the Baron does, or to let the Baron grab all the coins first . If you manage to finish the game with some coins in your container, the Baron will just harass you into playing again until he can win them off you...in the best-case scenario. Strangely, he will not do this if you manage to keep all of them.

The End:

    Flip the bowl upside-down (yes, your floor will get wet, deal with it). ONLY do this when you have encountered a red flag detailed before, or when all the coins are gone. I cannot stress this enough: do NOT do this in the midst of the game in the hope of keeping your remaining coins. You wouldn’t flip the table during a game of chess either, and the Baron does not take kindly to cheating (see below).

    Turn on the lights and snuff out the candles, but do not close the front door just yet.

    Check your symbols of scarcity as well as your container. If you have fewer coins than you started with (>0) OR if your symbols of scarcity have moved or vanished, you are to purify those rooms immediately. In the latter case, you may already be too late in preventing those rooms from getting ransacked.

    Even if you or the Baron possess all coins, purify the entrance hall the next day.

The Baron searching your house for riches is probably the biggest real threat that can rear its head during this ritual. He won’t exactly be subtle about it. That being said, he will not harm you unless you provoke him or cheat. He will consider the following as cheating: • Using a container that’s anything but completely empty • Having another person in the room (they CAN be present somewhere else in the house, as was the case with me) • Using toy money or non-monetary coins • Tampering with the coins in any other way • Grabbing multiple coins at the same time • Having both of your hands in the bowl at the same time • Filling the bowl with salt water or keeping salt on your person • Keeping a hand behind your back or in your pocket • Addressing him (it is recommended not to speak at all until after you’ve turned on the lights) Do NOT do any of these things. Keep in mind that just sitting there and letting the Baron win will make you look weak. There’s no telling what kind of unwanted attention such an attitude may draw… Carrying a lucky charm is not considered cheating but, as I’ve mentioned before, DO NOT wear jewelry. Not sure if watches or piercings count, but it’s really better to be safe than sorry in these circumstances, isn’t it?

Even though I won, I would not play this again even if the entity would still accept. There’s simply nothing to gain what I didn’t already have, and there's always a risk of reeling in something undesirable. If you are going to play it though, good luck and stay stafe.

She heard the bare-bones process and its background story from a tour guide a few years ago. Didn't think it would work but she tried it nonetheless and it did. She filled in the blanks and details using her savvy from other rituals (never use 13 objects, what the symbols of scarcity could have been etc.), which is why it ended up being more detailed. She's very into those things, so I trusted her judgement. When I asked her why she never posted the recipe herself she responded: "I thought it was fun to have something only a very limited number of people know". She was okay with me posting it only because that bargain was part of the dare.

The Gamblers Night - play cards with spirits. It beats solitaire. 1 player.

[Recipe] The gambler's night: How to play cards with spirits.

Hello everyone. It’s me with another game if you wish to play so. Its fun this one. It’s called the gamblers night. Again I won’t go much into the history of it. Throughout ages a deck of cards has been one of the most common and easiest ways to converse with spirits. Ask any phoney tarot reader or “psychic” in this age.

Now this game is pretty simple. You play a round of poker with someone or something for that matter. If you win, you get what you want. If they win, well...they essentially get what they want too.

Before we enter this game and I explain the rules and everything; first I must tell you that every card game works on three key factors. The first factor and the most prevalent one I feel is luck. Ask any experienced poker or rummy player. No matter how much of a Vincent van you are, if you don’t have lady luck on your side, then things might not end well for you. If there’s a simple miscalculation or a card shows up on top of the deck instead of what you expected it to be further down. Like i said, luck is essential for this game. So if you’re the kinda guy that randomly finds money on the street or in your pants pockets this is a game for you. Unlike me who always seems to get the short end of everything.

But don’t worry if you’re not lucky, the second factor might help you mitigate your first factor. The second key factor is skill. Just plain old talent of how well you can read your opponents hand and how you implement your strategies. Every skilled player has their strategies. Maybe you should be aggressive, accept losses on the first dealt hands and wait for the big payout at the end to play your best hand? Or maybe you should be defensive, you know. Not throwing away your first dealt cards and accept a stable footing instead of going for the risky but big payment in the end. It’s entirely up to you how you implement your strategy and how you deal with what you have been dealt.

The third factor is your ability to bluff. How well you can keep a plain face when you have the worst hand in the game and keep a steady hand knowing that if you lose you might as well have forsaken your life? It’s no mean deal, the ability to bluff is very well respected in all circles of card games. But because you are playing with spirits, they will have a heightened sense of your emotions. So you might not want to depend on this factor too much.

Now before you start any of this, you must not play this game anywhere near your house or your locality. The reason is that any spirits that come to play with you might be familiar with you. Spirits can already read and interpret humans pretty well. A spirit that knows you will arguably have an advantage over you. They will already know when you’re bluffing, when you have a good hand and when you have a bad one. There’s no point in playing then. You’ve already lost.

So, to start you will need a standard deck of cards. That is a 52 card deck. Don’t mark the cards or fold them to know which ones they are. No cheating. Cheating is unacceptable even to spirits. The most humane thing that can happen is that your deck might start burning and you might be punished or reprimanded slightly. Throwing you forcefully across the room is the mildest punishment I’ve heard of. The worse that can happen is...well guys worse things can always happen. Remember that.

Now before you even start any of this. If you have the deck right now in your hand and are reading the ritual. Stop reading the ritual and do what I say right now. Take out all the jokers and burn them. I’m not kidding. Literally light the four cards on fire and bury the ashes or spray them on the freshly tilled soil or something. Make sure nothing of the cards exists anymore. Now the jokers you see are one of the worst cards in the game. No matter who deals it, who plays it. If a joker turns up it’s all over. The joker is the only card that allows the spirit to directly physically harm you to death. So by taking the jokers out of the deck, you’ve made yourself safe to being outright killed by the spirit. Oh don’t worry the spirits can still hurt you but not directly kill anymore. Now you might be saying...isn’t this cheating? Well it’s not cheating if the cards don’t exist anymore in the deck is it? You can always play with the jokers in the deck of course. That’s entirely up to the suicidal maniac in you.

Now you will need a quite place, a table and two chairs and of course the deck. Turn off the lights, shuffle the deck thoroughly and sit down. You will need to see the cards so you will need a light source. A candle is preferable of course. Put the candle down on the table and put the deck on the table. Now here’s where things get interesting. You never know what kind of spirit or spirits might turn up to play. That’s the biggest risk in this game. Not knowing who your opponent is. Because in poker, you don’t play the cards, you play the man behind the cards. Not knowing what is in the other chair is certainly a disadvantage for you.

If the chair moves, if you hear any odd sound or if the candle light flickers out quit the game and get the hell out. If a spirit is strong enough to do this much physical activity, you don’t want anything to do with it.

Don’t worry. You’ll know when your guest has arrived. Oh you’ll know for sure. Now unlike normal poker games or any other card games for that matter, there’s no scoring in this one. It’s just simple betting and playing the hand.

What do you bet for? Of course knowledge. Anything you want to know, you’ll get your answer. They are bound to honour the wager. What will you bet? You don’t have any knowledgeable power over them. So you bet the only thing you have. Yourself and your personal things.

Win a round and you get your answer. Lose the round and it’ll depend on the hand you dealt that will decide what happens to you. You will be the dealer of course. So deal three cards each to both the players facedown. Deal the spirit first, its common courtesy and then deal yourself one. So now you must be wondering how do you know which card the spirit is playing? Well that depends on the type and strength of the spirit. Some might whisper the card in your ear, some might simply move the card closer to you a little bit. Some might just flat out pick up the card and hand it you. If the spirit is strong enough to pick up physical objects, you might not want to play with it. Just a suggestion.

Now what do each of the cards mean and what effects do they have?

Firstly Ace’s are the best cards for you to have. Ace means protection and if the spirit has any of the more aggressive cards, which I’ll describe below you can deal the ace to protect yourself for only that round that is played in. Consequently if the spirit has an Ace, it doesn’t need any protection but what it can do is cancel yours with its Ace. But again, it can be a bluff. Be on your toes.

The next is the deuces. The deuces you play will mark the severity of what and how much you can ask. One of spades? You can ask a simple question. Five of diamonds? Ask the next day’s weather. Ten of hearts? Maybe ask for the next power ball lottery number or something. Again it is entirely subjective and up to you. Ask what you want and ask appropriate to your card.

If the spirit plays the deuces though. Then its deuces will mark the severity of what it can do to you. For example If the spirit gets One of spades, you will might feel a light slap on the wrist or a gentle caress on your cheek. Five of diamonds? You might be physically pushed. Knocked down from the chair or something equivalent. Ten of hearts? Now this is a little bit unfortunate. You might have deep scratches on your body, you might start bleeding a little. Entirely dependent on the spirit as you can see. Don’t worry. The spirit can’t kill you or harm you mortally. But a ten usually means blood. It also depends on the type of spirit. A benign spirit might just give you short scratches and marks that might fade away in a week or so. A malignant spirit will leave deep scratches trailing down your back, staining your shirt red. Also I should mention that punishments aren’t only physical. They might try and toll on you the emotional damage. Usually happens with people who are more emotionally vulnerable. They might tell you the fate of your loved one, of how they will die in a car crash the coming month. Or how your boyfriend has been cheating on you while he was on an “office field trip”. Again one of spades? They might just tell you that your mother is a dirty hag. Ten of diamonds? Well you can already imagine. It won’t be easy to deal with but it’s not supposed to be. Anything and everything is on the table.

Queens are arguable the worst cards after the joker of course. If you draw the queen it’s fine. Count yourself lucky that the spirit didn’t get it. If the spirit draws the queen then you might as well just quit the game right there. A queen drawn by the spirit will erase the boundary between you and the spirit. It can’t physically kill you right? It doesn’t need to. With the queen it will attach itself to your spiritual self and will haunt you, follow you wherever you go. An exorcism or the equivalent might get rid of them but until that time the spirit will torment you however it wants. You are totally under its power.

Kings are free passes. If you play a king card, you can play another card uninterrupted by the spirit and the spirit can do the same to you if they play it. And ideal strategy for those seeking information is to pair a king with a ten and play them together. This will guarantee you get whatever burning question answered and then you can simply stop playing.

Finally there are special exceptions: Firstly, there’s the two of clubs. If you play hearts, you recognize this as the starting card. Playing this is beneficial especially if you play during the beginning. The response card will not be an action you have to do to yourself but will be a truthful assessment of your opponent. If they respond with a low number, they are a benign entity. If they respond with a higher card, well...that’s unfortunate. When the spirit plays this card, it functions as a normal deuce.

Next is the king of hearts. Also called the kind of murders or the murder card. This is unpleasant. Not the worst card, arguably, but certainly not pleasant. This card is simply put, murder. If you play it, it merely functions as a free pass but when the spirit plays it, you are obligated to either murder someone or commit suicide. Again, the choice is yours. It’s pretty bad actually but if the spirit is benign it might actually just accept a tribute of pain instead of actual murder. Tribute of pain usually means inflicting gruesome pain on either someone else or yourself. So torture essentially. Don’t blame me. That’s just the rules.

Finally queen of spades. The ultimate chance card. If you play the queen of spades, you get to see the spirits hand for that round. If it has any harmful cards or aces it will have to discard them. If the spirit plays the queen of spades, it gets to see all your cards in your hand for that round. It can pick out any aces, essentially protection and any high ranking deuces so you will not get your way.

The best part about this game is: you can quit when you want. Of course the card that has been dealt will always take effect but after the turn is over. If you want to quit, just close your hand, put it in the deck. Thank the spirit for playing with you and be on your way.

And always remember guys. Worse things can happen.

How much are the spirits manipulating the deck here? There's no such thing as a one of spade. Well, okay technically there is but it's better known as the Ace of spade which the ritual says does something different. And what happened to the Jacks? Were they replaced by ones?

Can't you just burn away all of the cards except the kings and the tens. I mean it would significantly improve your chances of winning wouldn't it? And its not cheating because those cards don't exist anymore. In the same thought by mathematical induction you could just burn away all the cards and play without a deck or burn away any unwanted cards.

We used to play a very basic divination game with card decks back when I was in high school. From what I recall with that game you did NOT want the Ace of Spades because it was bad Ju-Ju, there were also some other cards that meant specific things like the 2 of Hearts was a romance card and 10 of Spades meant suffering, I don't remember most of the others. I wonder if any of those rules apply to this game. Also, what happens if you draw a Dead Man's Hand?

[RECIPIE] The Best Player in the World

Let me tell you about a certain player from the Shadowside. This is a ritual meant for anyone who bored and tired of being a video game master or champion but want more than this games.

But I have to warn you, you may get more than you want.

I won't tell you what happens next, but I'll tell you on how you do the ritual to summon the Best Player in the World.

Ingredients:

    A video game with a multi-player component.

    Some candles and a match

    A video game console or a computer.

    A bottle of salt water and a pack of salt.

    A tag

    A piece of paper

Setup:

    Wait until you reach between 12 am to 3 am.

    Next, light the candles and turn on the video game console or the computer.

    Tie the tag to the controller or the mouse with you name written in blood and your video game ID.

    Start the game and open the multiplayer component. It's must be local or infrared multi-player if you don't want to fail the ritual.

    Now write down the piece of paper about challenging the Best Player in the World, surround it in salt and pour it with salt water until it is wet.

    Dry the piece of paper on top of a candle until its dry and bring it to the console.

"Do not anger the best player in the world"

So T-Bagging is probably a bad idea?

[RECIPE] Messages From Beyond

This was taught to me in college by a close friend who claimed to be a medium. The object of this recipe is to communicate with spirit in the form of mental images, much like most mediums receive. This must be done in a group of 2-5, more than 5 people will become somewhat hectic. All participants must be open and trustworthy.

1)Find a dark room and use only 1 candle for light.

2)Appoint a mediator who will write what messages are received.

3)Select a spirit to focus on, such as a passed family member or friend. Preferably, only have 1 person know the deceased so they can be sure the messages are pure. It would also make the most sense for the person in your group who knows the spirit to act as mediator.

4)The mediator MUST open the circle by asking that only spirit with good intention enters the circle. If you do not, you are opening yourselves to malevolent spirit.

5)Sit in a circle with eyes closed, attempt to clear your minds of anything except summoning the selected spirit.

6)It may take a few minutes, but hopefully random images that may or may not seem relevant will fill your mind. Have the mediator write down the images. Because the mediator knows the spirit they should easily be able to make a connection to what is being said.

7)Asking questions may help validate the presence.

8)You must close the circle by saying you close the portal to spirit and no longer allow them to contact you. Then you can blow out the candle.

I have done this a good number of times and almost every time we were able to contact someone.

The phrase about good intentioned spirit hit home. My dad's ex-girlfriend died around 8 years ago. She was the nicest person I have met. My grampa feels the same way about her. Doing this would be nice, but my friends aren't ones to do things like this

[RECIPE] For the Acquisition of Knowledge from the Dream World [x-posting from r/ritualisticreddit]

I apologize beforehand for the length of this. It's an in-depth one, but it's my favorite.

As the most popular rituals I've seen recently involve mirrors, I'm here to present to you another, albeit with a much safer outcome. This one shouldn't be nearly as frightening, because you're going on a date! With yourself.

The purpose of this "date" is to gain some information about yourself. Would you like to know why you do something in a particular manner or why you made a certain decision? Do you have a habit that you can't explain the origin of? Maybe you'd rather find out about a confusing feeling you sometimes get or take a more psychonautic approach. Whatever your reasoning, by performing this ritual, you will have the ability to find your answer via the dream world whilst all your conscious barriers are down.

For those of you with experience in lucid dreaming, the preparation for this is much less intensive. If you're unfamiliar with lucid dreaming and would like to know more, I highly suggest r/LucidDreaming. Also, this ritual is a bit more intensive due to the ingredients needed for the important part of it, but I'll explain that when I get to it. On to the ritual!

Materials: Shot glasses/tea cups (dependent upon which version).

A large mirror (like the kind you would hang on a door)

Pen

Paper

Alarm clock

2 chairs

A small table

A tapered candle (color of your choosing)

A candle holder

Blanket/sheet

Matches/lighter

And most importantly Dream Tea/Dream Infusion

For a more potent effect, I would suggest the infusion, but the tea works just as well as long as the measure of ingredients is kept the same.

Ingredients for the Tea/Infusion:

2 parts Mugwort

3 parts Skullcap

1 part Wormwood

1 part witch hazel

1 part chamomile

--Honey may be added for taste or to combat bitterness--

note: all ingredients can be purchased here.

To make this as a tea is pretty straightforward. It's made the same way you would make normal tea, but make sure that it's in a nice teapot for the ritual. You're on a date, remember?

The Infusion requires a bit more effort. First, get a bottle of decent vodka. Empty out enough of it for the ingredients. You're going to want about a cup and a half to 2 cups of dry herbs per 750ml bottle. Try putting the herbs in cheesecloth or something similar and putting it in a separate container during the infusion process. It's not fun stuffing this into a tiny-mouthed bottle. Now, keep it in a dark place for 1 month. In order to increase the potency of the desired effects, allow it to infuse outside, during the night, under the light of the moon. Return it indoors before the sun touches it. After a month, the infusion is ready.

If you're making the infusion, this is the perfect time to prepare your dreams, if you already don't, by keeping a daily dream journal. This will increase your ability toward dream retention, thus increasing the knowledge gained from the ritual.

Preparation:

    This takes place in a dark room after the sun has set completely. The windows need not be covered unless there is any light other than the moon and stars.

    Set up the small table with the teapot/bottle on one side and the pen and paper on the other. Have the 2 chairs facing each other. Each chair should have either a teacup, mug, or shot glass in front of it. In the center of the table, place the candle-holder and candle. The candle should not obstruct the reflection of your face when sitting in your chair.

    In one chair, place the mirror, facing the opposite seating. In regards to the direction of the placement within the room, the back of the mirror should be facing the light-switch to the room. The chair with the mirror should also have the blanket folded on the floor beside it.

    Beside your chair, place the alarm clock.

    Develop the question you wish to have answered. If you have multiple questions, discern the most pressing one and save the others for another time.

    Take this question and create a mantra from it.

Steps:

    This ritual is done before going to sleep. Once the night has come, and you have decided to go to bed, turn off all the lights in the ritual room.

    Before sitting down, light the candle in the center of the table.

    Take a seat (but do not look into the mirror yet!).

    Pour both drinks.

    Set the alarm clock beside your chair to go off 33 minutes from the time you put it down.

    Look into your reflection's eyes (from this point forward, do not break eye contact with your reflection).

    Raise your glass and pronounce, "To me!"

    Drink your drink.

    Reach for your partner's drink.

    Raise the glass and pronounce, "To us!"

    Drink the drink.

    Take the pen and paper.

    Begin chanting the mantra created from your question.

    Your reflection will change. It may be subtle; it may be overt, but you will know when it does. At this point, stop chanting and begin automatic writing/automatism.

    Continue writing with unbroken eye contact until the alarm goes off.

    Blow out the candle

    Leave your chair and turn on the light behind the mirror.

    Without looking at the mirror, cover it with the blanket/sheet.

    Banish with laughter.

    Review the automatic writing, looking for a repeating or particularly striking phrase.

    Reduce this phrase to a sigil.

    As you go to your sleep, place the sigil beneath your pillow.

From my experience, this is a very powerful ritual. You will get the answer you desire whether or not you actually want to hear it. Difficult, hard, or brutally honest truths are not uncommon, but not necessarily frequent. This ritual could simply provide evidence for an already nagging belief that you had. The bottom line is this: you have the ability to know anything about yourself. What do you want to know?

Does the tea version require a month too or is it just the infusion?

Just the infusion. The tea can be made instantly. I provided the two options for that reason: if you're really good at dream recall, you can go ahead and use the tea method and do it whenever you want, but if you need practice and time to write a dream journal, you can go with the infusion. However, performing both methods, I would suggest the infusion as the alcohol further draws out the effects of the herbs.

It does come naturally. Also, it's not quite a full 30 minutes. Sometimes it takes longer to reach trance/see your reflection change than a few minutes. Once you begin writing though, you'll be amazed at how quickly time passes.

The difference between these two is that I have "infusion" signifying the use of alcohol. The tea just uses the herbs with water.

During automatic writing, time tends to go a lot more swiftly than you would expect.

Black Mirror recipe - how-to guide for building your black mirror that communes with the dead. While supplies last. 1 player.

[Recipe] Black Mirror for Waking the Dead

Hey all, I've got something some of you might be interested in. It's a recipe that can be used multiple times, and all the hard work has to do with the initial construction of the object, which is pretty easy as well. This is not a creepypasta or anything like that, I actually came up with this idea myself, tried it, and had some weird stuff happen.

Also, fair warning, this is kinda long...

For starters, I do have to disclaim that I don't know if this will work if you're not into Khemeticism, the religion of ancient Egypt, because it uses elements of that religion. I guess, try it and find out! That said, this is a bit different from a lot of the games and rituals here, it will work for some people, it won't for others.

Anyway, onto the fun stuff.

-You'll need a picture frame, the bigger the better, but also the cheaper the better

-You'll need matte black enamel spray paint (Testors brand works pretty well, seems to dry faster than other brands and that's desirable for reasons I'll point out later.)

-Bat's Blood ink from any spiritual or occult store- you can also order it online. Dove's Blood ink works just as well. I don't recommend using your own actual blood, as it isn't necessary, and is probably dangerous to use for this.

-Calligraphy or parchment paper.

-A quill, calligraphy pen, or small unused paint brush.

-Pliers.

-Rubbing alcohol.

-A metallic sharpie, whatever color you like, I used copper because it looks cool.

-A piece of cardboard.

-Rubber cement.

-And a thick, black cloth, large enough to cover the mirror and thick enough that you can't see through it. This is the most important part, which I will also explain in a bit.

Now, to begin- do this alone, I cannot stress this enough, once the construction has begun, do not allow anyone to bother you or tamper with the components. When I made mine, my girlfriend was in the other room, but she is also into spooky stuff like this and knows not to interrupt a ritual. You'll want to find a room that you can do this in where you can close the door and won't be disturbed. Also, please read all the directiins first, you'll want to be able to do this quickly.

On a clear, cool, dry night (for the sake of helping the paint dry faster), take out the glass part of the frame, and clean the hell out of it with rubbing alcohol. Any dust or smudges will mess this up, even fingerprints have to be completely cleaned off. Be careful not to cut yourself on the glass this object is potentially dangerous as is, do not get your blood on any part of it. Wear gloves if you're accident prone.

Next, take the glass outside, and lie it down on the cardboard, making sure there isn't a gap for the paint to seep through to the other side of the glass- you only want to get it on one side. Spray your matte black paint ad try to get it as even and consistent as possible, but youll have to do two coats so it's ok if it isn't perfect. Note: hold the spray can about 10 inches away from the glass, air bubbles will ruin the entire thing.

When you're done with that, get to your room, take your time doing so, because once you start the rest, you'll want to spend as little time as possible in there.

Close the door and start with the frame, take your metallic sharpie and, on the front of the frame, were it will show, and on all four sides, write the words "wake the dead". Then, draw a square border around the words towards the outside of the frame. Again, you'll want this to show when the mirror is assembled. And you'll want to make sure there is no interruption in this border, it's very important that the lines are solid and connect at the corners, as the border's purpose is to help keep things... contained.

Then, take your pliers and pull off the fittings from the back of the frame. You don't want there to be an option to hang the frame, that's a higher chance for it to break, and if breaking a regular mirror is bad enough, breaking this one would be catastrophic.

Lastly, and there's a reason you do this last, get out your paper and Bat's Blood ink, with your writing instrument, and write on it the first four lines of the Pyramid Text Utterance 373- the Hymn for waking the dead. I'll save you having to look it up:

"O, raise thyself up, Unite thy bones to thee, Collect thy limbs, Shake the earth from thy flesh."

Rubber cement this paper on the inside of the back panel to the frame.

The reason I say do this last is because as soon as I wrote the word "flesh", all hell broke loose in the room I was working in. I won't detail what happened because I don't want to be accused of inciting a placebo effect. Suffice to say, you will not be harmed, but things will get weird, and I advise you to not look behind you for the rest of the process.

The reason for suggesting a paint brand that I know to dry fast is because hopefully, by now, the first coat will be mostly dry. So grab your spray paint and head out. Make sure you close the door to your room behind you. Then go ahead and spray your second coat, make sure to be really thorough this time, the second coat doesn't have to be perfectly smooth so feel free to spray a little extra.

After that, go back to your room. Close the door and get on your phone to pass the time or something, doesn't matter what you do as long as you're in there keeping an eye on everything. About a half hour should be long enough for your paint to dry.

Go out and get your mirror, again making sure to close all doors behind you. When your mirror is dry bring it in and look at it to make sure the coat is completely even. It's normal, if you hold the glass up to the light, for some light to show through, set it on te floor and you should only see shiny black.

Put the glass in the frame shiny side out, and put everything back together. It's pretty important not to look into the mirror after you've put it together, I did by accident and saw some disturbing things behind me in the reflection. By this point the weirdness in your room will have reached a peak, as the components once assembled amplify each other. Wrap the entire mirror with your black cloth, and things will immediately calm down. Keep it wrapped unless you plan to use it.

Using it is, well, up to you. The general effect is, really weird things will happen at unpredictable consistency, so I don't advise leaving it uncovered for too long. But it is very important that, once you've "used" the mirror, to leave it face up, outside, where it won't be disturbed, on the next clear new moon for an hour. You can use it as often as you'd like, and leaving it under the new moon is actually entirely optional, but letting too much build up in the mirror from too many uses could be dangerous.

Again, I don't guarantee an outcome, this involves part of an ancient Egyptian ritual, and those don't work for everyone. I do encourage you to try this, as there is no real risk involved other than minor injury from construction, and at the very least, you'll have a neat curio to show for your efforts.

I'm pretty interested in others' results, so if you do this please do share.

(Edited for spelling, 'cause I wrote this in a hurry)

I don't see a relation between Khemeticism and Islam. Abrahamic religions and polytheistic religions don't exactly coexist or have much of an effect on each other.

Christianity, for example, stole the concept of "amen" from a Khemetic deity of the same name, their religion depends on the concept, but Khemeticism itself is hardly affected by the this. Monotheism itself is actually a pretty new concept, but the doctrines of these systems are seperatist in nature, and that seperatism coupled with rabid recruiting techniques makes abrahamic religions large, true enough, but the value of what they teach is often cheapened by their refusal to accept the possibility of the legitemacy of outside belief systems.

Abrahamic monotheism is confined to its own very small world, comparing the two types of belief system is like comparing apples to oranges, on the terms that the oranges have chosen to define, which is all well and good, but it doesn't legitemately apply to the apples.

I can PM you about it, I didn't include it here because I'd rather the results be unexpected for the sake of testing my recipe. I came up with the idea because I practice the Khemetic religion ad have used the Hymn before, but I've also used black mirrors in the pas for spooky stuff and had the epiphany to combine the two.

The Stalking Game - game of chance and divination. 1 player. 1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/brokeneyelash

[RECIPE] The Stalking Game

To start, you need to wait until you feel the urge. You will know it when you feel it. You must wait to do this until you feel it. When you feel a strong urge to do the ritual, you must do it right at that moment. Do not plan it ahead of time.

When you go, locate the nearest crossroad. Go there and wait. While waiting, reach into one of your pockets and choose one item. Hold this in the palm of your right hand. If you have nothing in your pockets, you must spit into your right hand and make a fist as if you are holding an item.

Look up upwards and wait for the first bird you see.

If the bird is a dark color, spin clockwise. If the bird is a light color, spin counterclockwise. If there is no bird for longer than 10 minutes and you start to feel like you are itching, spin both ways (meaning, you will spin twice).

Yes, this ritual might end up making you look a little weird in public, but this is what is required.

After spinning, wait for the next stranger who passes by you. (If there is more than one person at a time, it is whoever is closest to you). Pay attention to that person's clothing.

If that person is wearing a dark color, follow them on the same side of the road as you are both on. If that person is wearing a light color, cross the road and follow them from the other side of the road.

Follow that person until you lose them. Keep holding the object in your hand or keep your fist with your spit closed.

The next step very much depends on the outcome of your following that person:

If you lose the person because you lost sight of them or couldn't keep up, you must go home and get in bed. Stay there until you fall asleep.

If you lose that person because they went back into a house, wait until your regular bedtime to go to bed. Then fall asleep.

If you lose that person because they went into a store or other building (not a house), you must stay up for at least 24 hours before going to sleep.

When you get home, place the object in your hand under your pillow (if you aren't sleeping right away still do this right when you get home). If you had spit into your hand, you will need to spit into your hand again and then wipe it underneath your pillow.

Do not set any alarms. I repeat, do not set any alarms. If you wake early, don't remember your dream, or are unsatisfied with your sleep, go back asleep. Wait until you sleep. Sleep until you dream.

You will dream of one or more of the following things:

    Future events (possibly including your death)

    Spirits who have been watching you during the ritual can come into your dream, talk to you, advise you in various matters, and so on

    A bloody woman missing her eyes may appear

    An old man who will stand and stare at you unceasingly may appear

    A figure of an angel

    A figure of a demon

    Various other things representing light or dark or other such things

As you can probably tell, this is a game of opposites. It is up to chance whether this turns out to be a positive or negative experience for you.

Question: When you are following the stranger, are you supposed to stop following them when they enter a building, or do you keep following (as long as it is a public place) until you lose them?

given what it says I assume if they leave the street and enter a building it is time to go home.

    If you lose that person because they went into a store or other building (not a house), you must stay up for at least 24 hours before going to sleep.

I live in a relatively small town so I was a bit worried about how long I was going to have to wait for a stranger but thankfully it actually ended up working out for me. I wasn't waiting for too long. A big city would be...interesting.

The person I followed went into a house so I just had to wait until my regular bedtime. I ended up sleeping for a long time...14 hours. I ended up in a place of my past. A place I've wanted to return to but am unable to return to due to being so far away now. I saw it so clearly. It was as if I was really there again. A very vivid dream.

I decided I wanted to go to a restaurant I often went to when I lived there. When I got to the restaurant, there was no food and no other guests. The hostess was an angel who didn't speak. She just motioned me towards a table and then I sat there waiting for a while. Then an older man sat down at the table with me. I asked him, "Will I ever be able to come here again?" and he told me that I could if I set my mind to it but that it wouldn't be the same as it was before.

The rest of the dream, I wandered around looking at places I used to go and then I woke up.

So, it was overall positive but definitely left me with a very bittersweet feeling. It was very eerie, though. Very eerie how vivid the dream was.

Mine was very past oriented but that seemed to be the exception compared to my friends who also did it. Most people had a focus on future events. Then again, perhaps returning to that place is in my future. I didn't feel like I was necessarily in the past.

Theory: The different ways you can end up doing this effect the dream. Like if you spin clockwise and follow on the same side of the street maybe it will be a good dream of the future with an angel or something.

Thanks for your question. You stop following them once they enter a building or home.

You also stop following if you lose sight of them on the street. Those are the three cases in which you stop following.

I suppose it is possible as it is with any activity like this.

I've tested this out with people and none have reported being physically hurt or possessed. Myself, my experience was overall positive (though it left me a bit sad) but some other people had negative or haunting experiences. Often the emotional effect is lasting but nothing physically harmful has been reported to me.

Arsgang - old Swedish divination recipe. 1 player. 1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Årsgång (pronounced [ˈoːʂgɔŋ]) is an archaic form of Swedish divination.[1] It is sometimes translated as the year walk[2] or yearly round.[3]

According to Swedish researcher Tommy Kuusela,[4][2] Årsgång was a complex form of divination in Swedish folk tradition, usually practised at Christmas or New Year’s Eve. The phenomena could vary greatly regionally or even in the same district, but the general course was the same: if the practicers ("year walkers") had managed to follow certain instructions and to solve particular challenges (such as encounters with supernatural beings), they would catch glimpses of what would happen the following year.

Petrus Gaslander's 18th century Beskriftning om Svenska Allmogens Sinneslag och Seder… ("Character and Customs of the Peasantry") describes the årsgång, and says that it is no longer practised. He writes that to undertake the årsgång, one must walk into a forest before first light on Christmas Eve, without looking at a fire and without food or drink, and walking so far that the crowing of a cock cannot be heard. Having done so, the "year walker" will now be able to see the events of the future, and by looking at fields and the roads approaching churches can learn of the harvests and funerals of the coming year.[2]

Japanese New Year Ritual - Meet the Wise One and ask it a question. 1 player.

Allegedly a Japanese "New Years Ritual"

Technically I should probably put this one in quotation marks — “Japanese New Year Ritual” — because I haven’t been able to confirm that it actually is a Japanese New Year ritual and not just a creepypasta (possibly written by someone who isn’t actually Japanese) masquerading as one. Besides the fact that I’ve only been able to find this one on creepypasta sites and places like Wattpad, the thing that kind of makes me think it’s more creepypasta and less ancient mythology is how it deals with food. I’m by no means an expert, but from what I’ve read, food factors prominently in Japanese New Year celebrations — traditional dishes and a whole lot of mochi are typically eaten in the days leading up to the ringing in of the new year. This “ritual,” however, does the opposite — it instructs players to fast, which seems at odds with everything else I’ve read.

But then again, maybe that’s the point.

As always, play at your own risk.

Players:

One principal. Requirements:

A basket or other container. Fruit: One pineapple, three bananas, two apples, and 30 grapes. Nothing more, nothing less. A timekeeping device. It must be as accurate as possible. Something sharp. A forest with a clearing. Anything you require to start a fire. Instructions:

The Preparation:

Begin when the clock strikes midnight on Dec. 31. Close all of your curtains. For 24 hours, do not eat anything. Do not drink anything. Do not sleep. Do not go outside. Two hours before the arrival of the year, prepare a fruit basket. Place within your basket: One pineapple, three bananas, two apples, and 30 grapes. There you should now be 36 pieces of fruit in the basket. Do not miscount. With your sharp object, cut your hand. Anoint each piece of fruit with a drop of your blood. Do not miss any. Do not close your eyes. Do not dress your wound. The Conversation:

At midnight, take your basket of fruit and your fire-making tools and go to the nearest forest. Walk deep into the forest until you find a clearing. Build a fire. Sit by it. Place the basket of fruit in front of you. Do not let the fire go out. Do not move unless the action you are taking is to ensure that the fire does not go out. If no one approaches you from the forest: The ritual has failed. Do not proceed. If a figure approaches you from the forest: You may proceed. The figure will make eye contact with you. Do not break it. Do not scream. Do not run away. Do not speak. After you have proven your bravery, the figure will begin to eat the fruit. Continue to maintain eye contact. Do not break it. If you have made it this far, the figure will ask you a question once it has finished eating: “What would you like to know?” Tell him. Do not look away. He will give you your answer. And then he will walk away. Do not look away until he has vanished from view. The Awakening;

Go to sleep. (You will not actually have to actively follow this step; you will simply drop off, whether you want to or not.) When you awaken, you will be in your own bed, newfound knowledge in mind. Concerning the Figure from the Forest:

He will be very thin and very tall. His eyes will be large and black. His mouth will be wide, and his teeth sharp. He will not be wearing any clothing. He will not be wearing any expression on his face.

He is called the Wise One. Treat him with the respect he deserves.

He doesn’t take kindly to those who disrespect him.

When Asking What You Would Like To Know:

Choose your words carefully. You may ask anything you like, from how long your life will be to what you’ll have for breakfast in the morning. But ask one question and one question only. Do not be greedy.

And Know This:

Whatever you ask?

Make sure you really want to know.

Once you have gained the knowledge, you can never go back, no matter how much you might wish to.

Knowledge is power…

…But it can also spell out your ruin.

I found this article on https://theghostinmymachine.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/the-most-dangerous-games-japanese-new-year-ritual/ and didnt wrote it myself. Credit goes to https://theghostinmymachine.wordpress.com/author/notflix/

for anyone who cares: yes im still alive, just simply forgot about the subreddit xD sorry i will try to find some nice rituals for you more frequently. ;)

Martha Game - ouija alternative using pens. 1 or 2 players.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Martha Game

Here in El Salvador there are many rituals and ghost stories which have been passed down from generations. The one and going to write about now is, you could say a ritual, a game like the Ouija Board in which you talk to the spirit world. I was told about this by my Photoshop instructor and I had to try it. It may not scare you but I will relate the truth, unlike other people who write stories based on plots of old or not well known horror movies. This "Game" was famous during the 1999-2001 time period, It was even featured on the news with pictures and videos of kids convulsing on the floor like it was a Dr. House episode. The reason kids were the most affected was because they played it in schools so She would give them the answers to the tests. Also almost anybody can play it for all you need is 3 pens if playing alone or 6 with a friend. So what you do is simple: you put the pens in your hand making a triangle with them. Once this is done you have to say "Martita quieres jugar conmigo?" or "Martha wanna play with me?", you say this three times. If she feels like playing then the pens will move, if the pens don't move maybe try later. So once the game has started she can answer any questions you have, however they have to be Yes/No questions. Lets say the pens are closed, forming the triangle, if the answer is yes then they will stay that way but if its no the the pens will open the triangle and vice versa. I played it and it worked! But i stopped doing all this dark stuff after I felt that I was being followed and watched, but many kids in school in tests who are desperate for an answer will play. I told everyone about it and little Martha started messing with them closing doors, and other scary shit. Honestly I don't if it will work in english but you might as well try it :D

It reminds me of 'the key and the book' which we played in highschool. Put a key in the middle of a thick book, tie it in place with a ribbon, two people are needed to play, each supporting the book in mid air by lifting it with a finger placed under the turn of the key protruding from the book. Ask which way is yes, which way is no? And the book turns accordingly.

There's a game that I played about 2 years ago with my cousins and it's almost exactly like this except it's called the Pencil Game and you do it with dull (or unsharpened) pencils. And instead of making a triangle, you hold them in the shape of 3/4ths of a square. Also, instead of asking "Martha" to play, we asked "Charlie" to play. There's a way to break the ritual too, when you're done, so the spirit doesn't follow you anymore.

From what I have on my laptop (we typed out all the rules and stuff as we were told), it says "To end the game, you both must chant “Charlie, Charlie, can we stop?” When the pencils move inwards or upwards, you drop them to the floor and say “Goodbye” to break contact."

Sounds just like the game "Charlie." Same exact thing, only you use six pencils to make a rectangle shape rather than a triangle. I've heard a lot of cases of kids playing "Charlie" and seeing shadows in their home afterwards. Mostly they claim to see the shadow of a body hanging from their rooftop.

[RECIPE] The Librarian Ritual
spoiler

'The Librarian' is the term given to an entity which appears under a very strict and specific set of rules. No one knows exactly what it is or why it appears under the conditions it does. However, I do know one thing for certain, that it has a higher chance of appearing in a library.

If you ever decide to attempt this ritual (NOT RECOMMENDED), be sure to properly follow the rules. Failing to do so will enrage The Librarian and you can be certain that the results will not be pleasant.

You will need:

*Thirteen candles.

*A book which centers around some ideology which led to the death of people. This could be the idea from a religion’s holy book to anything else. It must, however be the cause for a killing or mass killing of historical significance. If not, then at the very least, the ritual won’t work. At worst, it will be seen as an insult to The Librarian.

*A quill. It can be from any bird as long as it’s a feather that you can write with.

*Drops of your own blood, enough to write with and to draw a circle.

*A small desk or table.

*A sharp knife, good enough to pierce through the book.

*Matches.

*A handgun with two or more rounds of ammunition. If you’re with people, then they must individually see to the requirements for themselves. Keep in mind that this ritual can be done in any space, from 12AM to 4AM. It hasn’t been observed to happen at any other time. If you choose to carry this out then it is advised that you do it with a group of people, for safety reasons.

Carrying out the ritual:

Step 1: Find a spacious area with many exits so that you can escape easily if anything goes wrong during the proceedings of ritual.

Step 2: Place the candles in a circle in the center of the room and light each one with a six second delay after lighting the last one.

Step 3: Position the desk or table in the center of the circle.

Step 4: Place your book of choice on the desk or table.

Step 5: Take the quill and draw a large circle with your blood on the first page of the book.

Step 6: Write your name (or names) clearly within the circle of blood.

Step 7: This is where you must ask boldly, ‘What is the most powerful weapon?’ ‘Knowledge’ will be heard echoing through the halls, room or space, depending on where you are. It is believed that this is The Librarian’s answer to your question.

Step 8: Stab the book where you drew the circle. Ensure that your names are touched by the incision.

You will not be able to see The Librarian but you will feel the cold pressure of its presence. You may see a shadow from the corner of your eye. There is no need to look because if The Librarian has appeared, then it has already deemed you worthy. You’ll only ever truly see The Librarian if it wants to attack you.

After feeling the presence, extinguish all of the candles and burn all of the materials that you used, including the desk and the book, for they are now cursed.

As a result of the ritual, you will have an enhanced mental capacity beyond most. You’ll be on par with the most blessed and sharpest minds. The catch is, by doing this ritual, you have signed a blood contract with The Librarian. You will feel its presence wherever you go. On hot summer days you will cast two shadows and on long winter nights it will loom over you, unseen but present. Other people will not notice this and you will likely be driven insane by it.

This will apply to all the participants of the ritual. Remember, you must NEVER contact each other after performing it.

Oh, and you must’ve guessed by now that the handgun is to be used only if something goes wrong. If The Librarian decides to attack you, then by all means, do not hesitate to shoot it. If a single round has no effect, then the rest of the rounds are for you, for death is preferable to what it does to its victims.

NOTE: As many of you may already know, blood in a ritual can be used as a binding contract, which is why such rituals should be generally avoided. I’ve noticed that several rituals casually throw in the use of blood without mentioning the true consequences of it. Whether this is meant to lure in an unsuspecting individual or if it’s a result of just plain ignorance, is up for debate. I like the fact that this particular ritual clearly states the consequences of attempting it. Consequences, that should be enough to discourage most, in spite of the reward it promises. Regardless of whether this works or not, I wouldn’t recommend trying it out.

Nobody seems to have posted this particular ritual over here before so I decided to do it. All of the credit to goes to Naz1997. You can check out the reading over here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpgbKVsSG1Q

I think mentioning you can never speak to anyone in the group ever again should be higher up on the ritual personally. I've run into way too many idiots who only half-read the ritual until they're actually performing it and would probably end up cutting ties with their best friend if they tried this.

The Wall - feed a feline entity. 2 players.

The Wall: A (reasonably) non-fatal game

Recently I came across a game that is to a degree fun to play, but it can easily cause some long-term issues like mental trauma, bodily injury, death, or property damage.

This game is called "The Wall," and there are two difficulty settings. Basically, the goal is to keep a bunch of cups from being flipped over.

You're gonna need

    a stool. Don't use a footstool, like one of those with cushion and stuff, unless you want it to get scratched up. Well, whatever you use will probably get scratched up, but on a plastic or wooden one that generally isn't a big deal.

    a food bowl, or a saucer if you don't have one.

    water. A water bottle, a tap, anything.

    a knife. Something that can cut skin if the going gets rough.

    at least five pieces of cat food. The more pieces, the easier and longer the game is. If you want hard mode, use 5.

    opaque cups. You need double the amount of cat food you use.

    a room with a blank wall. The blank wall can't have any holes in it--windows, doors, nails, and so on. If you're playing on easy, the room should be well-lit. On hard, completely dark. The room should be pretty free of obstructions, and hard floors like linoleum or wood make the game easier.

    a flashlight for hard difficulty.

    a buddy on easy, a stranger you met after sunrise the day you plan to play the game on hard.

Setup

    Put the stool an arm's length away from the blank wall and put the bowl on top of it. Put the knife somewhere close to the bowl. If anything goes bad, cut yourself and bleed into the bowl, and break the bowl against something (throwing it on the floor works). This ends the game prematurely, and I'll tell you important times to do this. You could end the game at any time in this way.

    Exit the room, and have your buddy (or new friend) fill the bowl with water. Have him/her put all the cups on the floor all around the room, hiding the cat food under them. You WILL have more cups than cat food. After hiding the cat food, your buddy has to cut himself and bleed into the water in the bowl if you want to play on hard. This reduces the chance the game will fail to start to zero, but will truly activate hard mode.

    Everyone in your house or whatever place you use for the game has to leave for six hours. It's useful to work out the times so that when you come back, sunrise is in a few hours, but you could start it whenever.

THE GAME

If you're playing on easy, go into the room alone. On hard, both of you have to go inside, your friend with the flashlight. You can't carry a flashlight during any part of the game, or the game will fail to start or worse (maybe an inherent anti-cheater measure?).

Make sure the bowl on the stool is empty. If it isn't empty, the game failed to start. That's not your fault, it just happens sometimes. If it isn't empty and it's full of something BESIDES water, you're gonna have to bleed into the bowl and break it. But if the bowl is empty, put your back against the blank wall, standing behind the stool. On hard your friend should also.

You have to say "The wall runs to me, and I feed it" in a language that is not your primary one. In German, it's "Die Wand läuft zu mir, und ich füttere sie" (A rough pronounciation: Dee Vahnd loyft meer, oond ihh foot-airt een). DO NOT SAY IT IN YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE.

After that, you can step away from the wall, but DO NOT look at it directly. Out of the corner of your eye is fine, but even then you probably shouldn't, just so you don't get distracted. The goal of the game is to keep the cups from being tipped over and the cat food being taken, while at the same time trying to look under cups, take the cat food, and safely put it in the bowl. If you've ever had a cat, you know what this looks like--the same thing will happen, only it'll be invisible. DON'T flip over the cups yourself. After you've checked a cup, put it back upside-down. You have to remember which cups you've checked yourself. And you don't have to be the most musclebound person to play the game, but you can't be unable able to unscrew a new, unopened juice bottle cap, or do a push-up or something. Some physical strength is required to keep the cups down.

If you're on hard, your buddy has to help you see in the dark by pointing the light in the direction that a moving cup is heard, or to help you find a cup in general, all while keeping at least his/her fingertips on the wall. S/HE CANNOT SHINE THE FLASHLIGHT ON ANYTHING BUT THE FLOOR OR A CUP. It doesn't like being seen, hence the "completely dark" requirement of hard mode. You might nick the thing with the beam, but so long as you don't follow it with the light on purpose you'll be fine. Also, if your friend accidentally lets go of the wall, you have ten seconds to bleed into the bowl and break it. Otherwise, God help you.

If a cup hiding a piece of cat food is being flipped over and you aren't doing it, back away from it and let it be eaten. Otherwise, if you successfully find a piece before it does, put it in the bowl. Once all of the cat food is in the bowl, the game is over, unless you're on hard.

If you're on hard and you've collected all the cat food, you have to take the bowl and play keep away with it. Your friend can keep the light on the thing now, it'll make no difference. You don't want the wall to get the food, and you have to do this until sunrise. Unless you are a pro at dodging big things, expect some injuries here, serious ones if you're unlucky. Don't even think about using the knife on the thing; you'll just make things harder on yourself. The person holding the flashlight won't suffer at all (unless they look at the wall, then they're screwed and so are you--by the way, don't look at the wall). If you fail in keeping the food away, try and bleed into and break the bowl within ten seconds. There's a good chance you'll fail though, and you'll lose. Once the sun rises, and the cat food has been successfully kept away for all that time, you win. If you started the game before sunrise and managed to find all the cat food after sunrise, you have to either end the game by bleeding into and breaking the bowl, or else keep the food away until the next sunrise. Try not to let that happen.

Make sure after you're finished on either difficulty to wash the bowl and cups with a mixture of blood and water before throwing them in the dishwasher; a lot of blood isn't required, even one drop is fine, but to be safe you should probably use five or six. If you don't do this, you'll start the game again six hours later without being setup, and that's bad.

Final Thoughts

I did say it was fun to a degree. Easy difficulty is enjoyable enough, and the penalties for losing aren't all that bad. Just a little cut and broken pottery. Hard difficulty adds a whole barrel of worms to the mix though; I've never tried it, only read about it. Personally, I don't plan on trying it. You daredevils can have a go and get yourselves hacked and slashed to ribbons if you want, but I'm perfectly fine as I am.

I'm not sure on the backstory behind this game. All I got was a commentary-less guide on how to play, unfortunately.

Oh and one more thing. If you do want to try this game out, remember this: DON'T LOOK AT THE WALL.

Edit: I was recently asked for more information on this. I don't really feel comfortable telling EVERYONE about it, so I won't, but you should know that there's more to this game (both as for gameplay and background) that I left out, for safety's sake.

Why does all rituals have that "potentially really fucking dangerous/lethal/scarring for life" aspect?

Can't we just fuck around with other stuff than our subconcious without setting ourselves up to be butchered?

[RECIPE] If You Want A Cat Scratch

I found this on grasscity.com posted by user Skunkariffic. I'm posting it here for the purpose of documentation, as I think a good use of this subreddit is cataloguing the different ritual/recipes that exist.

Here it is (Formatting by me, ritual text in italics):

    I was just sitting on the back porch smoking my bong, remembering all of the hilarious shit I used to do when I was little. I started to remember some of the creepy shit I did too, ouija boards and rituals (none of which did anything spectacular) but there was one in particular I vividly recall, that actually manifested into something I couldn't explain.

    I was in grade five and I had just moved to a new town. I was immediately welcomed by the students in my class, and met one student in particular, Shawn, that shared in my interests of the paranormal. After hearing us mention the subject, another student named Jay brought a poem/ritual that his older cousin had given him. Nobody could find it on the internet, even today I tried searching for it but never found one that quite fit my memory. Five of us, Me, Jay, Shawn, Sarah and Amanda were in one of the just finished bathrooms in the closed off side of the school (it was under construction but the workers didn't work during the day). The school was a very old school, had quite a creepy feeling in it to begin with, and so as we were in the half lit room Jay told Shawn to lie down. He kneeled down at shawns head, told him to close his eyes and started to massage Shawns temples in a circular motion. He then gave these instructions to Shawn:

        Imagine yourself in your bedroom. You wake up and go downstairs, and your mom gives you five bucks, and asks you to go get some bread from the store. You walk out of the door and on the way to the store a strange old lady walks towards you on the sidewalk. As you look closer at her you see that her eyes are white, she has big bloody claws, and in a hissing voice she says

        "If you want a cat scratch, cat scratch, cat scratch, if you want a cat scratch I'll give you one!"

        This is a little creepy and you begin to walk faster. You take a short cut down an alley, your heart beating rapidly, and you pass a couple of people huddled in the corner. As you start to approach you notice the same eyes, and they say to you,

        "If you want a cat scratch, cat scratch, cat scratch, if you want a cat scratch She'll give you one!"

        This is getting really scary now, so you run to the store as fast as you can. You open the door and grab a loaf of bread, and walk up to the counter to pay for the bread. The clerk of the store turns around to get you your change and when he turns back he has those same eyes, and says to you

        "If you want a cat scratch, cat scratch, cat scratch, if you want a cat scratch She'll give you one!"

        Now you're completely scared, your heart is beating a mile a minute, you run as fast as you can back to your house and burst in the door. You forgot the bread at the store and when you go to tell your mom what happened she turns around, and it's the old lady, with those same eyes, and same claws,

        She says,

        "If you want a cat scratch, cat scratch, cat scratch, if you want a cat scratch I'll give you one!"

    And after that Jay got shawn to stand up, and from what I swear I remember, there were scratches all down Shawns back. I was skeptical, so I suggested multiple people have it done. I tried to find every explanation, but I drew a blank. How could long, deep, claw like scratches show up when laying completely still on a smooth, clean, linoleum floor? I asked all of the people who participated to show their back before and after, and to rule out creases from the tshirts us guys all took our shirts off to do the ritual and sure enough it happened still. To this day I still can't explain it, and I have nobody to re visit this phenomenon with because I don't know anybody who's interested in this kind of stuff at my age now haha

    I just thought this would be an interesting story to share, maybe find out if anyone else had done this or something similar when you were a little kid. Maybe try it out for yourselves maybe and post pictures if anything does/doesnt happen !

Source: http://forum.grasscity.com/philosophy/984672-creepy-childhood-games.html

Another version was submitted in the comments by amberwamber.

    I know I'm late to the party here, but my older brother, sister, and I used to play this game all the time, except our story was a little bit different. Ours went like this:

    One day when you were walking to school you heard a noise in some nearby bushes. Going over to see what the noise was, you saw a little kitten. School was starting soon you put the kitten into your backpack to find the owner once school let out. After school you searched everywhere for the owner, but had no luck. You took the kitten home, but knowing your mother would never let you keep a kitten, you put it in your closet. Eventually you forgot about the kitten. One day your mother heard the kitten meowing and scratching at your closet door. She opened the door and the kitten went crazy. It destroyed everything and scratched up your mother and scratched out her eyes. Then the kitten went after you.

    After the story we would lightly tap the person's head and say "Cat scratches, cat scratches, cat scratches." We always ended up with scratches on our backs.

My friends and I used to always do this when we were little! We'd always make light scratches on the person's arms and face throughout the story, to find unexplained ones on their back. It always worked without fail for us too.

Skeptic

My neighbor friends, who were a couple years older than me, would do this with each other when I was young. They usually fooled me though (I was a pretty gullible kid) and they never really showed me scratches - they just told me stories about their experiences with it, saying it made huge scratches all down your back. Once, one of the girls did it to me and said "Wow, it worked!" but I couldn't see anything. I pretended I saw the scratches though, because I wanted her to like me or some crap.

EDIT: Actually, the ritual was about an actual black cat that followed you down an alley, not an old lady.

Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board - group ritual to lift someone using only fingertips. Link is offsite. 4, 5+ players.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description

One participant lies flat on the floor, facing up, and then the others space themselves around him or her, each placing one or two fingertips underneath the participant's limbs. The person closest to the head commonly begins by saying, "She's looking ill," which is repeated several times, and followed by, "she's looking worse," which is also repeated several times. The general direction of the call-and-repeat describes how the person is looking worse and worse, followed by saying "she is dying," and, finally, "she is dead".

Variations of the spoken part of the game occur. In a common, modern version, the person being lifted is told a story about their death and asked to imagine it happening to them. This is intended to unsettle the participants, and to convince them that something may have changed making it easier to lift the person than before.

All versions of the game end with the phrase "light as a feather, stiff as a board" chanted by those standing around the "dead" player as they attempt to lift their companion's body using only their fingertips. Some versions omit the story entirely and only the "light as a feather..." chant is used. After these repetitions, the person being lifted is described by the group as having become lighter or even entirely weightless.

Another variation of the game takes place with one person seated in a chair. Four volunteers agree to stand around the sitter, two on the sitter's left side and the other two on their right. Each of the four places two fingers under each corner of the chair's seat and the four together will attempt to lift the chair and sitter, which generally fails. The volunteers will then perform some small ritual, usually involving rubbing their hands together or circling the chair in various direction (counter-clockwise, walking backwards, etc.) After this ritual, the volunteers hold their hands over the sitter's head to "transfer" energy into the sitter, which will presumably make them weightless. The lifters then retry lifting the sitter the same way as before. Also, it can be that the lifters lift the person sitting in the chair; doing the rest of the ritual as so, but holding at the four main points of the body (under the knees on each side and under the shoulders).
Explanation of the trick

The key to the trick is timing: each of the lifters must apply the lifting force at the same moment. When this is done, the weight of the subject is divided equally between each lifter, requiring each person to contribute only 12–20 kilograms (26–44 lb) of lift, to raise a 50–80-kilogram (110–176 lb) person.[3] This is about the same as each person lifting a heavy shopping bag.[4]

If the trick is performed without synchronising the lift, it will fail: as participants attempt to lift at slightly different times, they are instead performing a series of lifts by smaller groups, resulting in a much heavier weight per person. This fact may be used as a deliberate form of misdirection from the person explaining the trick, first asking the group to "go ahead, try to lift" to show that it cannot be done, and then asking them to try again on the count of three, where it succeeds.[3]

Some people who remember performing the trick as a child will have exaggerated their memory of the effect, recalling the performance as lifting the subject high into the air for some time, when in reality they would only have lifted them for a moment.[3]
History

The oldest known account of levitation play comes from the diary of Samuel Pepys (1633–1703), a British naval administrator. Pepys’s account of levitation play comes from a conversation with a friend of his, Mr. Brisband, who claimed to have seen four little girls playing light as a feather, stiff as a board in Bordeaux, France. Pepys’s account of Mr. Brisband’s experience reads:

    He saw four little girls, very young ones, all kneeling, each of them, upon one knee; and one begun the first line, whispering in the ear of the next, and the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and she to the first. Then the first begun the second line, and so round quite through, and putting each one finger only to a boy that lay flat upon his back on the ground, as if he was dead; at the end of the words, they did with their four fingers raise this boy high as they could reach, and he [Mr. Brisband] being there, and wondering at it, as also being afeared to see it, for they would have had him to have bore a part in saying the words, in the roome of one of the little girles that was so young that they could hardly make her learn to repeat the words, did, for feare there might be some sleight used in it by the boy, or that the boy might be light, call the cook of the house, a very lusty fellow, as Sir G. Carteret's cook, who is very big, and they did raise him in just the same manner.[5]

Pepys also spoke of the chant that accompanied this performance.

Voici un corps mort
Raide comme un bâton,
Froid comme le marbre
Léger comme un esprit,
Lève-toi au nom de Jésus-Christ!
	

Here is a dead body
Stiff as a stick,
Cold as marble
Light as a spirit,
Lift yourself, in the name of Jesus Christ!

The next recording of the game being played comes from The Magician’s Own Book (1857). This account differs from that of Pepys, as it is a direct account of the game being played. Also, this account focuses on a different version of the game than the version played by the girls in Samuel Pepys’ account. In this account, the heaviest man at a party in Venice, Italy, sits in a chair, and is unable to be lifted by six other persons, initially. However, after coordinated hand-clapping and synchronized inhalations and exhalations, the man in the chair is able to be lifted on the forefingers of the six lifters.[6]

The phenomenon has been observed into modern times, often being described as a form of spiritualism or seance and considered anathema by some religious groups. It is widely considered a simple spooky party game along the lines of Bloody Mary and the telling of ghost stories.

The game appears in the 1996 film The Craft, which follows the story of four high school students as they familiarize themselves with witchcraft and various arcane experiments—one of which is light as a feather, stiff as a board. In the movie, the four young women are seen performing the version of the game described in Samuel Pepys’ diary, which involves one participant lying down, while the others kneel around her. The teenagers chant “Light as a feather, stiff as a board,” several times before lifting the participant into the air. In the movie, special effects are used to show the person levitating above the hands of the lifters.

[RECIPE] Miss Fortune; or, A Date with Lady Luck

This is a ritual for those who are unsatisfied with their own fortune, those that believe that forcing a slight twist in their fate would be a worthwhile effort. However, it also demands an ability to get on others' good graces, no matter what kind of person —or otherwise— they may be.

You will need the following:

    A picture of a person whom you know and trust deeply. It should be a picture where the person is alone; pictures of several people can lead to complications. For a similar reason, it should be a physical printed photograph; a picture viewed on an electronic device could also cause complications. It should also be noted that, although this ritual can be performed with the picture of a living person, it works best if the one in the picture has died recently.

    A frame or some other means of propping up the picture and making it more visible (optional, but highly recommended)

    A piece of chalk

    Two candles

    Something to light them with; a lighter or matches will do

    Salt

    A power object – a personal possession of emotional value that will inspire confidence in you

In preparation for the ritual:

    Begin at night, at a time when most of the people around you are asleep. 2-3 AM is usually ideal, but you'll have to make your own judgement based on the area where you intend to perform the ritual.

    Prepare the ritual in a room with as little connection as possible to the outside: windows, doors, etc. Try to achieve complete darkness, cover up any windows if you have to. Make sure you are completely alone in the room, and that you will not be disturbed while the ritual is proceeding.

    Place the photograph in the centre of this room, facing the place where you will be sitting. This is why a frame is recommended – you will need to be aware of the photograph's appearance throughout the entirety of the ritual.

    Draw a chalk circle around the photograph. It does not have to be perfect; in fact, you should make a slight elongation in its perimeter around the area where you'll be sitting so that you can easily reach it with your arm without moving your body. However, take care not to make the circle too big.

    Place one of your candles inside the circle, between yourself and the photograph. If the candle is so big as to obstruct your view of the photograph, you can place it slightly off to the side - the important thing is that you're able to keep an eye on both. Place the other candle in a similar alignment, but outside the circle. Make sure the outer candle is easily within reach.

    When the hour you have chosen comes around, you may begin the ritual.

THE CALL

    Once it is time to begin, study the original picture one last time so that you may easily notice any changes it may undergo. If the room you're in has a light, you may turn it on now for this purpose, but you must turn it off again once you're done, and it must remain off for the rest of the ritual.

    Light the candle inside the circle, and only that one. If you must, realign it now so that it casts as much light as possible on the picture. After this point, avoid having any part of your body within the circle.

    Keeping the picture fresh in your mind's eye, close your eyes, and concentrate on good, friendly memories that you shared with the person in the picture. Think about them being kind to you, wishing you the best in life, generally being nice and kind. Hold your power object during this step, and do not let go of it just yet.

    Keep your eyes closed. When you are positive you have accrued a good amount of positive mental energy, chant the following:

     Dear friend's fortune, come to me
     Let me be your addressee
     That you do as you see fit
     How our memory has writ

    Open your eyes. Do not let go of your power object. Look at the picture.

    IF you do not notice any differences with the picture, the ritual has most likely failed. Do not proceed.

    IF the person in the picture can no longer be seen in it, DO NOT PROCEED.

    IF you see a figure or presence in it that fills you with horror, dread, or general unease, DO NOT PROCEED.

    IF the picture has caught fire, or has otherwise been damaged or destroyed, DO NOT PROCEED.

    If any of the former happen, skip to 'cancelling the ritual' immediately.

    IF you see a figure or presence in the picture that was not there before AND that does not immediately make you feel uneasy, you may proceed.

    Speak a question or remark out loud; something that only you and the person in the picture knew about, or that they would always respond to in a specific way.

    IF you do not perceive any kind of response, DO NOT PROCEED. Skip to 'cancelling the ritual'.

    IF you perceive a thought or voice in your head that you do not recognise, DO NOT PROCEED. Skip to 'cancelling the ritual'.

    IF you perceive a thought or voice in your head that corresponds to what that person would say, AND you are completely confident that it was in earnest, you may proceed.

    Once again, focus on the positive energy brought about by your recollection of the person in the picture. Being careful to remain focused on that, light the candle outside the circle, then gently reach out and erase the part of the circle nearest to you with your arm. DO NOT make any sudden violent movements. DO NOT speak out loud. DO NOT scream.

    If all has gone well so far, you should feel the presence gently emerge from the photograph's vicinity and surround you. It should feel friendly, comfortable, and put you at ease. Simply remain in place, focusing on the good memories of your friend, until you no longer feel the presence about you. This should not take more than a few minutes.

    Leave the room. Wait until dawn. You may sleep if you want to. Return, and clean up the objects you used in the ritual, except for the photograph – keep that in a safe place, where it will not be disturbed or misplaced. DO NOT damage or lose the photograph. DO NOT repeat the ritual in the same location or with a picture of the same person.

ENDING THE RITUAL

If you have completed the ritual successfully, you should notice a positive change in your life; things that you noticed were difficult should become easier, and appearing friendly before others should be a breeze. However, this will not last forever, and eventually you will feel your fortune returning to how it was prior to the ritual's commencement. When you are certain this time has come, you must perform one additional step to end the ritual.

Hold the photograph in your hand, and recite the following:

	So has life's path led back out
	To the crossroads, I've no doubt
	Heed my thanks, and go back whence
	Came your faithful influence

Burn the photograph, collecting the ashes in a container of saltwater. Dispose of the saltwater.

CANCELLING THE RITUAL

If something has gone wrong during the ritual, quickly do the following:

    Spread a circle of salt around the chalk circle. This is why you do not make the chalk circle too big.

    Retrieve the outer candle while being careful not to move inside the chalk circle. DO NOT break the chalk circle. DO NOT light the outer candle.

    Leave the premises. Do not return until daylight.

    Burn the photograph or its remains – if it is already burned, collect the ashes. Place the ashes inside a container of saltwater. Dispose of the saltwater, preferably someplace you will never have to return to.

    Perform a cleansing ritual.

    If you saw the photograph burning or being otherwise affected in a way that would require manipulating its basic physical properties, take extra precautions for a time. Assume that your fortune will get worse, and prepare accordingly. AVOID THE ROOM YOU USED FROM THEN ON.

Some background on the ritual's function:

Many believe that a person's will, while bound to their spirit, can manifest beyond the confines of their own body. Naturally, this can be helped along if the body and spirit have since become separated. In this incorporeal state, the will can interact with and manipulate others, helping or hindering them in invisible ways. The cultivation of a friendship with someone can stimulate this interaction of wills, sometimes even while both participant are still alive and well. Naturally, a similar interaction with the wills of enemies and anything else with the intent to do harm can still occur. The way in which these ethereal energies interact with one's own can be manipulated by creating a 'bridge' into one's own self, through which the energies would flow more easily. The tricky part, then, can be being absolutely certain that the kind of energy one is beckoning is a positive one. Even then, since these energies are products of the will, they can gradually burn themselves out and feel tired, unappreciated, vindictive, which is why one's link with them must eventually be severed. Even so, these types of energies are typically believed to be linked not only to the will of the living person they were spawned from, but also to other's memories of them, which is why they eventually dissipate and become neutralised over the course of a century or so. However, this is not guaranteed to happen.

It's the way it's written, and how we visualize one performing these rituals. The bold, capitalized text of "DO NOT CONTINUE" is indeed unsettling, and the whole thought of whatever unwanted entity you are potentially summoning leaves most lurkers in this sub uneasy. But we're still addicted to reading about these things, aren't we? :P

The Nesting Doll Game - your babushka doll will give you a wish, or maybe a year of bad luck. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/kukla-ne-plach

The Nesting Doll Game (xPost from r/nosleep)

Growing up in Russia, I was often gifted matryoshki (nesting dolls) by friends or family members (mostly my babushki) - so many that I even had a collection. The intricate detail and colour on each of them, even the tiniest ones, fascinated me.

(If you don't know what a mastryoshka is, here is a link.)

When I was a child, 9 or 10 years old, I went to camp out in the countryside. There, the senior boys always loved to scare the younger kids and show off their bravery to the girls.

A popular game they would dare each other to play was called "udachnaya matryoshka," meaning "lucky nesting doll." The goal of the game was to have any wish granted or receive luck and fortune for years.

My memories of that time aren't great, but I never forgot the instructions to this game.

Here's how you play it, to the best of my recollection. However, please note that I do not recommend playing this game.

What you will need:

    a few nesting dolls (you only need one to play, but you will see why many are required shortly)

    a mirror in a room with no windows (bathroom works best)

    many candles (around 10 is a safe number) and a lighter

    a piece of paper and a pencil

    salt

    a bin (a garbage can is fine)

    a lucky charm (something like a horseshoe or a religious item)

Set-up:

The game is best played after nightfall. Otherwise, exact timing doesn't matter. Again, I do not suggest you play this game, but if you do, you should prepare a wish or desire of something really important to you.

    Acquire a few nesting dolls. They should not be newly store-bought, as that diminishes the success of the ritual. The best dolls are gifted down generations or found at garage or antique sales.

    Take the dolls, candles, lighter, salt, and paper and pencil into your room of choice. This room must have a large mirror that stands on its own and a bin/garbage can. Hang your lucky object on the door handle outside.

    Close the door. The ritual works best with no one else in the vicinity, but if there are people, make sure that they will not disrupt you.

    Take one of the nesting dolls and take it apart entirely. This is extremely important: if there is an EVEN number of pieces inside the doll, toss all of that matroyshka's doll pieces into the bin and cover with salt. DO NOT put the matryoshka back together.

Repeat this step until you find a matryoshka with an ODD number of pieces. When you do, you may proceed. If none of the nesting dolls you have are odd-numbered, you MUST NOT play the game.

How to play:

Step One: With your odd-numbered matryoshka taken apart, arrange all the separate dolls in front of you, facing the mirror.

Step Two: Place a candle behind each doll and light it. If you do not have enough candles, do not proceed.

A side note: the more dolls inside the matryoshka, the greater the reward. But, the risk is also greater as the game will be more challenging.

Step Three: Turn off the lights in the room and face the mirror. You should be able to make out the faces of each doll in the mirror from the candlelight behind them.

Step Four: Study the details of each doll very carefully. Memorize their facial features, their clothes, their hair, everything. (This is why it becomes more challenging with more dolls). Take as much time as you need - there is no limit.

Step Five: Once you are certain you know how each separate doll of the matryoshka looks, turn around and face away from the mirror. You may close your eyes if you wish. Count to seven slowly.

Step Six: You may feel a chill or hear distant laughter. Do not be alarmed, just calmly turn to face the mirror again. This step is the most important.

If ANY of the candles have blown out, you must end the game immediately (see: ending the ritual).

If ANY of the dolls don't look like what you remember, you must end the game immediately (see: ending the ritual).

If the tiniest doll (the only un-openable one) has moved or has fallen over, you may proceed to the next step.

Step Seven: On your piece of paper, write down any wish you want granted. This can be anything you desire, but ensure that it is realistic, otherwise it definitely will not work.

Step Eight: Fold the paper an odd number of times and place it into the final openable doll (in place of the smallest one). Put the matryoshka together again carefully, ensuring that their colourings align in the centre and they all face the same way.

Step Nine: Blow out the candles and leave the room. Have someone you trust dispose of the other dolls in the bin, if necessary.

Step Ten: Burn your matryoshka promptly, ideally within the next hour. Keep the smallest doll piece, the one which your paper replaced, and put it under your pillow that night.

If, upon waking up, the little doll is gone, your wish will come true.

If the little doll is still there, do not fret. Keep it with you as a charm and it will bring you great fortune, although your wish will not come true.

If the little doll has changed physically in any way overnight, that means you failed Step Six of the ritual. You may burn it immediately, but it is likely too late and you will suffer bad luck for a year.

Ending the ritual:

If something happens that requires an immediate cessation to the game (including any interruptions such as a knock on the door), you must work quickly to follow these steps:

    Blow out all of the candles (do NOT turn on the light - it will not work).

    Grab the door handle. Close your eyes and say "ya ne hochu igrat'" ("I don't want to play") seven times.

    Open the door and leave the room. DO NOT return. Have someone you trust toss all the dolls into the bin and cover them with salt.

If the lucky charm is missing from the door knob on the outside when you open the door, leave the house immediately. Do not return.

If during Step Six of the game, one of the dolls has changed to look like you... I'm sorry.

I'm confused about the even/odd number part - You say you may only play with one if you wish, which is two pieces, which is an even number.

But then in the instructions, you say to use a few of them - take them apart and if they are an even number, don't play. Do you mean to keep buying sets of them until you find a set that's missing a top or bottom so it will have an odd number of pieces? I'm pretty sure I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, can you clarify please?

Each doll counts as one piece, including the center doll. A nest of five dolls would be an odd number, even if they divide into ten. Or, more accurately nine, as the center doll usually cannot open.

Oh wow, I really want to play this! Even if I am Bulgarian, some of our relatives used to have a few nesting dolls. I don't know if they have them anymore, though. By the way, when I go to the antique shop to buy a doll can I ask the owner how many pieces the doll has instead of buying a few dolls and hoping they have uneven pieces? Would that be breaking the rules of the game?

[RECIPE] The Water Game

Hey! Still new to this whole Reddit thing, so If I'm doing something wrong feel free to tell me :)

In light of this whole "water bottle" challenge stuff with people flipping water bottles and trying to get them to land perfect, I was reminded of this ritual I found back around 2010 on some Russian forum for paranormal short stories, creepypastas and a few rituals. I got most of the rituals copy pasted on an old USB because I was planning on trying them, but I never did. I got the USB out earlier today and read through it, so I decided to post this one because I haven't found it anywhere else on Reddit.

The game requires at least 2 players to work, but there can be no more than 7.

You will need:

• A room that can be completely submerged in darkness.

• A table

• A light source of some kind (cellphone, lamp, candle, ect)

• Bathtub

• A cup made of glass for every player

• Water source

• Paper

• Pen

• Knife (optional)

• Abandoned building (Recommended but also optional)

• Bucket

• Alarm clock / timer

• Plastic Water Bottle

How to play:

• 0. Make sure it is 12:00AM - 2:00AM when you start playing.

• 1. The players must make sure that the only things in the house are players. No pets and nobody else that isn't willing to play.

• 2 . Get a piece of paper, and write your name. Then you must write which of the 7 Deadly Sins can be applied to you. For example, if people would describe you as "selfish", you would want to write "Greed" as your sin. If you are lazy and unwilling to do most things, you would write "Sloth". If you for some reason lie about your name or the sin, revert to Safety Step #1

• 3: Fill your glass with water close to the brim. If it overflows, than revert to Safety Step #1. You will also want to fill the bucket up with water.

• 4. Once all glasses and the bucket has been filled, go into your dark room with the table.

• 5. Use your light to put all pieces of paper on the table and then put glasses onto the papers. Then place the bucket underneath the table.

• 6. Leave the room with the table and go into the room you started in. Set your alarm clock for 3:00AM. You must lay down and close your eyes at exactly 2:00AM. DO NOT fall asleep. DO NOT open your eyes. No matter what you hear or feel, DO NOT open your eyes. You may move your arms and legs or move to adjust yourself to keep yourself awake, but don't do anything more than that.

• 7. Once the alarm is set off, open your eyes. Lay there for about a minute and make sure there is nobody else laying down in the room besides the other players. If there is something else laying down in the room, all players should leave the room as soon as possible and go to Safety Step #1. After this is done, do a cleansing ritual on the house. If there is nobody else in the room, you may continue with the ritual.

• 8. All players head to the room with the table and glasses. Check all glasses. If your glass has been drank out of, then go to Safety Step #1. If your glass is empty, tipped over, broken, or empty, then refer to Safety Step #2. If your glass has not been tampered with, Continue the game.

• 9. This step is very important. If the following steps are broken, then there will be far more consequences than having just one demon in your house. Step 9A will be the steps if there 3 or more players left. Step 9B will be for 2 players. Step 9C will be for 1 player.

•9A. All players drink from there glasses and then sent the glasses down. All glasses should fall except one. The one person who's glass did not fall goes onto Step 10. If either no glasses fall down, all players glasses fall down, or more than one player is left, go to Safety Step #2.

•9B - The two remaining players will pour the water from their cups into a plastic water bottle and take turns flipping the bottle. The first one to land the bottle perfectly upright will go onto Step 10. Make sure the lid is on TIGHT. If water spills out of the bottle, refer to Safety Step #2.

•9C - Refer to Safety Step #2.

•10 - Go to your bathtub. Pour the water from your glass into the bucket, and use the bucket to fill up the bathtub. Sit in the bathtub and fall asleep. (Steps 7-10 must be completed between 3:00-4:00 am and the person must be asleep by 4:00.)

• 11: At this point, you will be dreaming. You will see a man at a table with 7 different drinks. 3 of the drinks will satisfy the needs of your deadliest sin. For example, if you wrote "Greed" on your paper, you would be granted whatever you greed for and would never be put in the situation where you would have to share your riches. 4 of the drinks will kill you. You will have no way of telling which ones are which. DO NOT drink if the cups are not glass. DO NOT drink if the man is looking at you. DO NOT move if there are no glasses. Just sit there.

• 12. Once you have drank, you will wake up. If you do not drink, you will wake up eventually.

• 13. Do a cleansing ritual on the house. At 5:00, your friends may re-enter the house, and the ritual will have ended. Enjoy your prize!

Important rules to remember:

• NOBODY who has left the house may re enter until 5:00.

• Follow all the other rules above!

Safety Steps:

• #1. Take your glass of water and pour it into the bucket. Rip up your piece of paper into 7 pieces and put it into the bucket. Then place your glass into the bucket. (Ends game for player. If this has to be done, the player must leave the house and not entire until 5:00AM.)

• #2. Leave house and dispose of glass somewhere far away from house. Do NOT enter the house until 5:00AM. (Ends game for player.)

I'm not sure I appreciate the vagueness of the "prize" or the idea of the jars killing you. What is the prize? How would that even work? And why leave your house?

No good feelings on this one.

Edit: I don't mean this as in, "this is a poorly-made game". I just mean, there's a lot to weigh here, and anything that offers you one of the seven deadly sins with "no consequences" should definitely be given a second thought before trying it.

There are some things I don't get. Will the persons glass that didn't fall down float in the air? How will you know if somebody drank of your glass? If a persons glass didn't fall, what does the others have to do? What if the person doesn't fall asleep in the tub? Can I open my eyes and cover them with my hands instead of closing them? There is a risk that somebody will fall asleep.

For the fall down question, the glasses are on the table. What the recipe meant by fall down was tip over. You will know someone drank if the glass has less water than you had in it before. If the glass didnt fall, they move on to the next steps. If the person doesn't fall asleep in the tub, the ritual doesn't work. Yes, you can open your eyes and cover them. As long as you can't see.

[RECIPE] Seeking Selene's Favor (Dangerous.)

In the first days when humanity still existed in a benighted state, we once worshipped the moon. She went by many names—Selene, Mahina, Metztli, Elatha, Phoebe—but perhaps her oldest name was Louskna. Although humanity has long forsaken her, there is still a way to seek her favor.

In any city, in any country, go to any empty church or place of worship during a dusk when the full moon is rising. Should anyone be inside, forsake your quest and come back on another night. Should this holy place be empty and silent, however, say a quick prayer to whatever god you hold dear and enter. You will need all the fortitude that you can get in the trials to come.

Feel free to admire the beauty of this holy place, but once you are ready go to the altar and declare in an authoritative voice that are you are ready to pay tribute to “Louskna”. At this point, you will need to defile the altar. Feel free to be creative, but whatever you do must be significant enough to attract Her attention. Once you have done the deed, close your eyes and pray that your actions were deemed acceptable.

Should it remain dusk, you have failed to earn Her favor. Your offering was not sufficient, and she has perceived it as an insult. Flee as fast you as can, and avoid the moonlight where Her power is strongest, lest she punish you for your insult. Although Her strength is largely gone in these dark days, she still has the power to condemn you to an existence worse than death. However, if you open your eyes and it is night outside, take a deep breath and ready your mind, for the real test is about to begin.

Within minutes, an eerily beautiful and pale woman in a white dress holding a candle should appear to you and beckon to you to follow. Do so, for to remain in this place alone is to throw away your life to the darkness. She will lead you into the catacombs of the place of worship. It will feel like an eternity of winding hallways and empty chambers—even if the place of worship was a mere chapel or shrine. Slowly, the rooms will begin to appear to become more ancient, the architecture more primitive, and the art more reflective of the tastes of peoples and civilizations long gone. Familiar religious images of crosses and crescents will disappear, replaced by animals and celestial objects, and finally things beyond your comprehension. The art will become more difficult to understand, and you will begin to see the images of long-forsaken deities—do not look too deeply, for there is a reason why humanity forsake these horrid entities.

Finally, you will reach your destination—a courtyard underneath the full moon. You will know you are in the right place if the sky is pitch black except for the radiant moon and there is no sound but the wind rustling through misshapen pine trees. Show proper respect, for this is an ancient place.

Now pay close attention to the following instructions for ritual is everything. In the middle of this courtyard, there will be a knife made out of bone. Take it, kneel down, and whisper "I offer my flesh and blood to you, Loushkna," and begin cutting your arms. She is a capricious and cruel entity, and prepare for a fate worse than death should she be unsatisfied with your offering. The goal is to bleed as much as possible without falling unconscious. It has been a long time since she received any worship, and she is thirsty for blood. Your mistress will stare coldly and passively with an uncaring expression. Keep cutting—even if you must begin cutting off fingers or ears—until you see the faintest hint of a cruel smirk on her pale flawless face. When this happens, you may stop, for you have sated Her thirst.

She will then come up to you, and put a small bone effigy into your hand. She will then begin caressing your face. Her pale, eerily beautiful, face will move up to yours and she will begin whispering in your ear. She will tell you of all the bad deeds that people have done in the name of good causes. She will tell you of shamans who sacrificed babies in vain for a chance of rain. She will tell you of inquisitors who burned innocent “infidels” to save their souls. Of warriors who tore out hearts for the strength to save their families. She has witnessed every such fall, and she will leave no story untold. Finally, when she becomes silent, only one task remains. Before you pass out from the loss of blood, take the knife, and kill Her in the cruelest way possible. Once this is done, feel free to enter the bliss of unconsciousness. When you wake up, you will find yourself unscathed back in the place of worship where you began. In your palm, you will find the bone effigy that Louskna gave you. Hold onto it dearly, for it will give you Her favor.

When in doubt, look to the moon for it will forever be your guide.

Haha, thus the label "Dangerous." I refuse to do this ritual because of these risks. As an obligatory disclaimer, I also strongly discourage anyone from doing this ritual.

By the way, what is the purpose of this? Why is it worth the risk? What does the moon goddess do for you?

I intentionally excluded the rewards from the instructions. I learned of this ritual from a very old hunter in Wyoming. He seemed deranged. Thus, I corroborated most of his claims using other sources (old books on myths and legends, interviews with legitimate moon cultists, and even archaeological records on long-dead religions). Of course, I cannot confirm the validity of the ritual, but at least there is some sort of support for something like this existing. Unfortunately, I could not confirm his fantastical claims for the rewards of the ritual. Thus, take what I am about to say with a grain of salt.

He claimed that Louskhna granted him three powers. First, he claimed could transform into a bear at will. He said that each successful supplicant is assigned an animal. He claimed that this is one of the sources for werewolf and skinchanger myths. Second, he claimed he could predict the weather and natural disasters. This seemed the most plausible as he did predict to me a thunderstorm a few days before it happened. Finally, he claimed to be immune from disease and to be 150 years old. He boasted that he was still a young "pup" as some of his kind lived up to 250. He refused to display any of these powers.

It is possible this ritual is a source for the "Skinwalker" myth. The Skinwalker myth is one of the oldest in human history. Thus, there are many legends surrounding the creation of a Skinwalker. Perhaps it is even possible that there is more than one way for a Skinwalker to enter the world. Unfortunately, I have not done enough research to do more than speculate on the matter. Thus, I apologize for not being able to give a more definite answer.

I do, however, again strongly discourage all readers from doing this ritual. I have never done this ritual and thus cannot confirm whether this ritual even works. And as you point out, perhaps it is for the better that it doesn't.

You raise a good point. This bothered me too when I was recording the ritual. The hunter who told me of this ritual refused to divulge the rationale on why you had to seemingly kill Louskhna. He simply stressed that it was vital for the success of the ritual. I have several theories, however.

First, Louskhna--to me anyway--seems to be a form of mother goddess. Perhaps the brutal killing of her is symbolic of how we must all in a way turn our backs on our loved ones if we hope to achieve our ambitions. For example, we must all one day leave the family home to make our own lives. Maybe the brutal betrayal is a far more extreme display of that same concept. Or it could even be some form of final lesson that Louskhna imparts to the supplicant. Or perhaps its the opposite. Maybe the brutal act is meant to sever the relationship in some way. My source stressed that we can never full trust Her. Even if you enjoy Her favor, she is a cruel and capricious goddess. She can easily toss you aside on a whim. Perhaps seemingly killing Her is meant to break any sympathy or dependence you might have on her. Or to display that you are even strong and vicious enough to even merit favoring in the first place.

In the end, this is all speculation. Without my source, I cannot say for sure why it is necessary. I apologize I cannot give you a firm answer.

Thank you for your reply, I appreciate it so much. I love the rituals you post, you put a great deal of care into making them beautiful pieces of writing & they are extremely well researched. Those are two profound interpretations. You're probably right, perhaps it's a "final test" to prove that you can be as heartless as She. I was thinking maybe by the end of the ritual you are deeply connected, & in a sense you are brutally destroying a symbolic piece of yourself, after destroying your physical self for Her. I just hope this man didn't deliberately give you faulty information, but I'm sure you would have sensed it if he was. It would be impossible for me to destroy a sacred goddess for any amount of personal gain, so I'm definitely not cut out for this one.

I am touched by your incredibly kind comment. Moments like this make me glad I chose to pursue this scholarly interest of mine. I peruse r/threekings (and r/nosleep) quite a bit, and I share these rituals to return the favor to the community. I am very pleased to know that they are being enjoyed.

As to your thoughts on the symbolic killing...I like your interpretation. It makes sense because the ritual seems make Louskhna and the supplicant nearly one and the same. The man who shared this ritual with me seemed somewhat disturbed. So unfortunately, I cannot vouch for the truth of the ritual. But I did not sense that he was lying about this piece of information. From what I remember, he was silent for a good 15 seconds before he continued speaking. Perhaps that act was a particularly painful memory for him.

The Señorío ritual - a black ritual involving blood and effigy meant to harm a victim. 2 players.

[RECIPE] The Señorío Ritual

I have been traveling around in Mexico on vacation and from various antiquarian archives, local interviews, and excursions off the beaten path, I have come to learn of a dark and highly unsettling ritual which I believe r/nosleep, r/threekings, r/creepy, and the rest might enjoy hearing about. Page by page, document by document, account by account, I have built up a knowledge of the ritual sufficient to tell a little of its history, procedure, and negative effects. Despite many other rituals which have been described across the Internet, this ritual cannot be done easily, and I am skeptical if it can even be done at all in this modern era with the limited information we have. However, it would not hurt people to know of its nature.

The Señorío ritual (also called the Manor ritual) is a highly obscure ritual that originated in an undetermined manor in the countryside near what is now Mexico City during the mid to late 18th century. I can attest to the fact that materials on the Manor ritual are sparse or difficult to access, given that most had few, if any, copies made. This is compounded by the fact that a large portion of those pertinent materials are decayed to the point of being unreadable, and are only known to pertain to the ritual due to their having large diagrams and illustrations depicting it. Due to these factors, some aspects the nature and history of the ritual are disputed and many more are unknown. However, the following aspects are generally agreed to be true:

    The ritual was performed almost exclusively by peninsulars and criollos, people in the New World who were at the top of the Spanish sistema de castas racial hierarchy. This was most probably due to the ritual requiring complete control of a large manor house, something that was out of the reach of those in a lower caste.

    The ritual was practiced sparingly, only used a few times by a certain number of wealthy families. This, along with the nature of the ritual itself and the enigmatic status of many materials covering it, suggests that the ritual was an extreme taboo among those who knew of it.

    Performances of the ritual decreased sharply with the end of New Spain and had stopped entirely by the late 1840s, around the time the Caste War of Yucatán, a Mayan uprising, started. There appear to be no links between the two events, however.

It is speculated that the inspiration for the ritual has links to the human sacrifice rituals that were practiced regularly by the Aztecs, although such links are tenuous at best. Indeed, the only similarities between the two rituals is that the location of the origin of the Manor ritual is close to the ruins of Tenochtitlan, and that both rituals focus on stairwells and blood.

A typical performance of the ritual would vary slightly from family to family, but generally adhered to the following process:

    A manor would be selected for the ritual. For the ritual to work, the manor would require at least two stories and a straight stairwell from one to the other. The manor's seclusion would also be an important factor, as a more secluded manor was considered better for the ritual. Once the manor was selected, it would be cleared of all persons save those needed for the ritual.

    A location in the manor where one room is directly above another would be selected (the description typically given is “el piso de la sala superior es el techo de la sala inferior”, that is, the top room's floor is the bottom room's ceiling. Furniture would typically be cleared from both rooms. Portraits and family heirlooms, if present, would most definitely be removed. If both rooms have windows, then they would be covered by some means. After that, a lone chair would then be placed in the center of the “superior” room, facing the door. In the “inferior” room, the floor would be covered with linen. A pike would be made to stand perpendicular to the floor in the center of the inferior room (and preferably the center of the superior room as well) by use nails or some other means.

    An effigy of the “victim” of the manor ritual would be prepared by an assistant, usually a servant or younger member of the manor's family. Such a victim would usually be an enemy of the family or an object of the performer's envy. The effigy would often be a crude likeness made of straw, cloth, and wood, although in some extreme cases the family performing the ritual would use a newly dead or killed Native or African laborer, painted and dressed to caricature the victim. Whatever form the effigy took, it would be affixed to the pike to stand upright. The effigy would be affixed so as to not touch the floor.

    Well after dusk, the performer of the ritual, usually the lady of the house, would sit in the chair in the superior room in the dark. From here what should happen next in the ritual differs from source to source. Some sources say that the assistant should leave and close the door behind him – this is the earlier custom, performed mostly before the 1800s. In this variation, the performer should cover their face with a sack or cloth. Other sources say that the assistant should place a full length mirror upright beside the door before leaving and leave the performer three lit candles for dim light. After the assistant closes the door behind them, the woman should then place the mirror so that it leans against the door as vertically as possible and faces the chair, and then place the candles in front of the mirror. This is the later custom, performed mostly after the 1800s.

(Side note: There are more than twenty variations to the Manor ritual aside from the two mentioned here, but they are quite minor and a comprehensive list of them is too long for this post.)

4. From here, the assistant would take a container of “sangre negra”, or “black blood”, to the inferior room. This is the term used in all readable sources, but what exactly the substance is is unclear. In illustrations, it is often depicted as a red liquid, dark to the point of almost being black (in one source it is completely black, the same color as the text). Given its name, some have ventured to conjecture that black blood is blood mixed with ashes, although that conjecture does not help answer the question of exactly what animal the blood would come from. Regardless of the composition of black blood, the assistant would pour directly it onto the victim's effigy, and loudly chant “Él te derriba,” (He casts you out) seven times. There should be enough blood poured to cover the effigy and drip onto the linen on the floor.

5. Upon hearing the seventh “Él te derriba”, the performer in the superior room would then start to perform their part of the ritual. If the performer is adhering to the earlier custom, then they should cover their ears with their hands, and continuously chant “Dios no ve este casa,” (God does not see this house) repeatedly. If the performer is adhering to the later custom, then they should perform the chant seven times, then stare at the mirror in the dim light and bare their teeth at their reflection, blinking as seldom as possible.

6. While the performer is chanting or staring into the mirror, the assistant waits in the inferior room for the moment when “el diablo ha tenido suficiente para beber”. This literally means “when the devil has had enough to drink”, although in the Manor ritual it signifies the moment when the black blood has stopped dripping from the effigy onto the linens on the floor. Once this has happened, the assistant would leave the inferior room, go to the superior room, and knock on the door to indicate to the performer that it is time to start the next phase of the ritual. The performer would then leave the room, relocating the mirror and candles if necessary, and go to the head of the stairwell. The assistant would then go downstairs to the inferior room.

7. The assistant would detach the effigy of the victim from the pike and bring it up the stairs to the performer. The performer would then take the effigy from the assistant and throw it down the stairs, saying “Él te derriba,” like the assistant did when they poured the black blood on the effigy. From there, the assistant would carry the effigy back up the stairwell, sometimes with assistance from others, for the process to repeat again. Depending on the family, the process would happen as few as three or as many as seven times. With each iteration, the performer would say “Él te derriba,” louder and louder, from a whisper at the first iteration to a shriek at the third to seventh.

8. From there, the assistant would incinerate the effigy, and the ritual would be completed. It is up to the performer or, usually, their assistants, to clean the black blood from the stairwell, remove the pike and linens from the inferior room, and remove the chair from the superior room. If the later custom was adhered to, then the assistants would also remove the mirror and candles and store them in a secluded location. Almost all readable sources that describe the later custom recommend that the family performing the ritual never use the candles or mirror again for any purpose. Furthermore, they warn gravely against shattering the mirror anytime during or after the ritual.

Upon the conclusion of a correctly performed ritual, the victim represented in the inferior room is supposed to come to a sudden and unfortunate end. Most sources claim that the victim would be hit by a severe and untreatable fever that should kill them before the end of seven days, although a small minority describe deaths varying from death via consumption to suicide to being killed in their bedroom by a dark figure. Due to the complexity of the ritual, however, there are numerous ways it could go wrong, and many mistakes and their consequences were documented in both texts describing the ritual and various family histories, as any deviation could had ominous effects.

The most common mistake is to pour too much black blood onto the effigy, letting the liquid drip onto the floor for far too long. Though the ritual should start well after dusk, various sources emphasize how it needs to be performed quickly, and a small number warn that if the ritual drags on after midnight then it could have deadly consequences. Rare but valuable personal accounts from performers of the ritual often note how they can feel an unnerving presence around them as they sit, head covered or uncovered, in the superior room. Notably, those who adhered to the later custom would often see their reflection slowly and subtly morph into a repulsive and demonic figure, baring its teeth back at the performer in the dim light. An obscure account from a servant's diary, one that was restored by a local librarian after many weeks of labor, tells of an envious aging wife who wanted to kill a woman whom her husband was doting on with the ritual, using the later custom. The servant, who was the assistant for that particular ritual, accidentally poured too much black blood onto the effigy, thus letting the ritual drag on past midnight. He described how, just as the trickle of black blood was beginning to slow, he heard a series of frantic screams from the wife above him. He rushed up to the superior room and pushed open the door, knocking the mirror onto the floor and shattering it. The wife claimed to have seen the devil completely materialize in the mirror and attempt to step out of it before it was shattered. Various times after that event, the servant records sightings of a dark red, almost black figure in various places around the manor and its grounds, sightings which stop with the death of the wife less than a month after the ritual.

The second most common problem that occurs during the ritual involves the phase when the effigy is thrown repeatedly down the stairs. From the repeated impacts many effigies fall apart, and can only be taken back up a stairwell in tatters. Limited accounts of this happening all mention that a foul odor beyond that of the effigy's material or that of black blood seems to emanate from the effigy's exposed innards, leaving behind a sickening miasma that seems to inhabit the stairwell for weeks. Those who use the stairwell regularly after that are documented as developing symptoms similar to those supposed to be inflicted on the victim. Perhaps most disturbing was the account of a family that used a fresh cadaver of a Native laborer. They had committed to casting the laborer down the stairs a full seven times, but on the sixth time the corpse opened its eyes and growled demonically. The panicked family incinerated the effigy immediately, terminating the ritual. The family patriarch, who describes the ritual in his diary, then begins to describe vivid nightmares and episodes of sleep paralysis involving the effigy watching him as he lay in bed. He writes of these incidents almost nightly for a month before his diary inexplicably ends.

Ultimately, though this ritual was a deeply interesting thing to research, it was mostly the product of superstition and a warped mixing of Christianity and Native culture. That's not to say that my interest isn't piqued whenever I come across fragments of its legacy in the places I tour across Mexico. In many an estate or manor I visit I am wont to come across a room, devoid of furniture or any markings of human life save a faint, sanguine smell with no apparent source. Usually on inquiry I am told by my host or hostess that the room is useless, or unremarkable, before they quickly close the door. It goes without saying that in most of those estates or manors there is an equally empty, useless, or unremarkable room directly above it.

Woah. That was amazing. It seems simple enough, yet is easily the creepiest thing I have read. Also, seems to me that the assistant has to do a hell lot of work in this, while the performer just sits and watches their reflection distort( a psychological trick). Also, it is downright horrifying for both, assistant and performer.

[RECIPE] How to meet a Celestial Anchorite

This ritual will allow you meet a Celestial Anchorite. Celestial Anchorites are divine scribes who live in seclusion, always recording the happenings of the world around them. They live cloistered existences, usually in bustling cities where there is more to record. In our hectic, fast-paced modern world, there are more of these entities than ever before. So, you might ask, what is the point of disturbing their solemn work? The reward for distracting them from their divine duties is the answer to any single question you have. They are more than happy to impart their knowledge, even if you ask about the future. You can ask about the price of a stock, how to make a certain person fall in love with you, and even inquire into the inner mechanics of the universe. Their knowledge is limitless. A Celestial Anchorite will not lie, not omit any necessary details, and not seek to cheat you.

This is not a particularly difficult or dangerous ritual. There are, however, certain preliminary conditions that you must meet before doing the ritual.

    You must be relatively pure of body and mind. Go in with a—relatively—clean conscience. So try to make amends, volunteer, or donate some amount. If you are catholic, confess your sins. This is entirely subjective, but the feeling must be real.

    Refrain from any drinking, drugs, or sex for at least 48 hours before meeting the Celestial Anchorite. They are divine creatures after all.

    Bring a gift as tribute as well; it does not have to be anything major. Celestial Anchorites will not demand your firstborn nor a fortune. A treasured memento from your past is ideal. Even a bottle of good wine should be suffice if you treasure your mementos too much (or have none available).

    Make sure you wear a respectable outfit when you try to visit them. A tuxedo is not necessary. Just try to avoid tank tops or sweat pants.

    Celestial Anchorites only entertain guests in spring or autumn. Make sure you plan accordingly.

First, you must identify the lair of your quarry. Celestial Anchorites live in larger cities; anything above 100,000 people will do. Unfortunately, you cannot intentionally just pick a city. It has to come you naturally. This is a bit difficult to put into words, but have you ever had a craving to visit a random city? If so, then that is a city where you might find your quarry. You have to pick a city that feels right. Just pay attention until you stumble upon the name of a city that you are drawn to.

When you identify a city, visit it and explore the town. Go wherever feels right. This is probably the most dangerous part of the ritual. For example, I do not recommend visiting Camden, New Jersey at night. Regardless, continue to walk aimlessly until you find an apartment building that draws your attention. You will know if it is the right one. Go up to it and open the door. If there are any barriers such as a lock or gate, then turn around and leave immediately. DO NOT BREAK IN. This is not the location of a Celestial Anchorite. They are shy creatures but they will never turn away a guest. Return to your hotel, enjoy the rest of your stay, but give up your quest for the time being. There is no penalty for failure. The heavens will not strike you down and world will keep on spinning. Feel free to try again—if you are quick enough—even in the same season.

If the door is open or unlocked, then enter. This next step is important. Knock on three doors of your choice. If anyone answers them, leave the building and end your quest for the time being. If no one answers, however, you are very close to meeting a Celestial Anchorite. Next, pick one more door at random and knock. If someone answers, greet him or her with the following line:

“How can you say, ‘We are wise, for we have the law of the Lord,’ when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely?”

If they answer with the following line, you are standing in front of a Celestial Anchorite:

“The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped. Since they have rejected the word of the Lord, what kind of wisdom do they have?”

It will invite you inside. Enter and rejoice for you are one of the few people to ever meet a Celestial Anchorite. Now a warning; these entities demand respect. Treat your host as you would any other distinguished host. Of course, you do not have stand on formalities for your entire visit. Simply avoiding insulting it and make sure to say thank you and please.

Be patient with the entity. It is a welcoming host and a charming conversationalist. It is understandably very eager for your knowledge and will ask you many questions. It will goad you to say more and more, and dissect each word you say with bated breath. Oblige it, even if takes hours. In the meantime, admire the surroundings. Celestial Anchorites never live in large homes, but the abodes they do make tend to be simply, but beautifully, arranged and decorated. They often have trinkets from past epochs of humanity’s history. Feel free to inquire about them. After all, you do have all of the time in the world. If you wear a watch, you might notice that it is no longer ticking. Look out the window and you might notice that time has frozen. Leaves will stop falling. Rain will stand still. The sky will never turn dark. You are no longer in our world.

When you finally sense a lull, announce that it is time to take your leave. The Celestial Anchorite will undoubtedly be silent. They are lonely creatures and even they yearn for companionship. It might attempt to dissuade you from leaving. Do not—I repeat—do not, under any circumstances say anything implying that you will stay. If you accept, your life is forfeit and you may never leave. Not even death will release you. This apartment will become your prison until the divine trumpets sound and the Dragon once more walks upon the earth.

The temptations will begin simply enough. The Celestial Anchorite might offer you dinner. It might offer to let you stay until it stops raining or snowing. It might offer to let you stay the night. Refuse all of these offers.

The façade of normality will begin to dissipate. The ceiling might begin to rain with gold and other trinkets, and it will offer you unimagined riches. The room might suddenly fill with bookshelves, each shelved with unfamiliar and strange books. It will offer you the chance to read these tomes, and uncover all of the secrets of the universe. In order to allure the lonely to stay, it might slowly take an attractive, seemingly angelic form, its beauty rivalling that of Helen of Troy or Narcissus, and offer an eternal true love found only in fantasy.

Turn down all of these offers. In desperation, it might begin to hint of the splendor of immortality, and call you a fool for turning down a chance to live forever. It might began to shriek of the impending ruin of humankind. Finally, it might even insinuate that there is no heaven—or that you are damned to hell anyway—and that to refuse its offer is to throw yourself into the darkness. Ignore these lies. Stay silent if you are too weak to unambiguously refuse.

Finally, it will fall to its knees, and begin to beg and cry. It will offer anything you desire. Demand one thing: the courtesy due to all guests. Then ask your question.

It will slowly get up and give you the answer you seek. It will tell you exactly what you want to hear. It will not omit any details no matter how gruesome nor disturbing. It will not lie to you. It will not obscure your answer by being vague or obstinate. It knows exactly what you want and will give it to you. Once you have your answer, graciously offer your thanks and leave. Go back to your hotel and sleep soundly; your quest is over.

One final note: Celestial Anchorites do not stay at the same place after a visit. If you return, there will be nothing there but an empty room or a confused tenant. You must go to a different city and repeat the same process again if you wish to make another visit.

No, I have not personally done this ritual. I interview a lot of people about the supernatural. I learned this particular ritual from a Hermeticist. He claims to have done this twice. He refuses to do it again, however, because he felt like he was too close to accepting the Anchorite's offer.

Did he share anything about his experiences? Such as if he asked a question about the mysteries of the universe and what their answers were.

Soooooo, it says the ritual isn't difficult or dangerous, but you might get stuck there forever or might get yelled at. That's dangerous and difficult for people like me who can't turn down people crying. I'd accidentally say yes and get stuck there, so I cant do this... ಠ_ಠ

I'm a bit disappointed to hear that no one here has done this.

I'm really curious to hear about actual experiences from regular people who try this.

I'm very tempted to try this but, it does seem risky, mostly in the part where you might seem like a trespasser.

If the door to the building is locked, when can you try again? The next day? Or do you have to go to another city?

Also, why are they so lonely? Did they choose to be a Celestial Anchorite?

In theory, you should be able to try again the next day. Unfortunately, you must repeat the process and identify another city to visit. This will probably take a week or so to do.

Also, why are they so lonely? Did they choose to be a Celestial Anchorite?

I have no idea why (or even if) they choose to be Celestial Anchorites. My source hypothesizes that they are lesser angels. The fact they can be lonely suggests they have some human feelings. Perhaps they are humans who accepted the offer to partake in this divine mission. I apologize that I cannot give a definitive answer.

Will I be able to play with a friend? As far as I know, no one has ever done this ritual with a friend. I think it will be more difficult, however, because Celestial Anchorites are naturally shy.

can I ask him or her why they are alone? Is that offending? This is a very good question. I think you should be alright if you ask politely and without malice.

The Staircase Ritual - detects supernatural activity. Takes 13 hours. -.- 1 player.

[RESCIPE] Staircase ritual

I did not wrote this Text, i just felt like this sub was suffering and so i thought about sharing with you. All Credos go to wikia.

Introduction

If you’re reading this, it’s likely because you’re at your wit’s end. You’ve been watching too many scary movies, or maybe you’ve read a few too many creepypastas, or perhaps you’ve just been left alone with your own thoughts for far too long. You keep hearing suspicious noises, you’re not sure but you think that shadow in the corner just moved, and/or you just feel a presence other than your own and you’ve become uneasy. At this point, you just want to know — and you want to know for absolutely sure — is there something in your house? Should you be worried about it? What’s going to happen to you if you succumb to your desire to close your eyes and go to sleep?

Well, you’ve come to the right place. If you really want to know, I will now delegate to you the first of many methods. This ritual is designed to detect the activity of the supernatural, demonic, or worse. Here’s what you’ll need:

Materials/Preparation

    A staircase, preferably one with twelve or thirteen stairs (excluding the landings) but you can do it with up to sixteen. It is highly inadvisable that you use a staircase with seventeen or more stairs or a staircase with eleven or less stairs.

    A small, portable fan. It’s suggested one that runs on battery. If you have one, you can use a fire puffer as an alternative.

    A cup of water

    A handful of dirt

    A candle. Make sure it is one that will not burn out easily. And something to light it with.

    A picture of your house or whatever stood in the place of your house from as far back as you can get

    A picture of your house as it is now

    A pair of dice

    Two watches or small clocks, preferably analog but if you only have digital, that’s fine

    A food offering. It must be an animal product.

    A mirror

    A handful of ash

    A few dust-bunnies

    A bug or another living and easily overpowered creature.

    Something from your body (a toe/fingernail, a lock of hair, saliva, blood, a tooth, etc.)

    Salt

    A weapon, preferably one made of silver

To begin, you will want to prepare your stairs. You must be aware of the exact time that you begin this ritual and you must begin during the afternoon as the entire ritual must be completed during P.M. hours. If you have twelve or thirteen stairs you will start by standing on the bottom landing. If you have more stand on the bottom stair and place the first item on the next stair.

From here recite: “It is from here whenceforth I shall commence.”

On the first stair, place the small fan but don’t turn it on. If you’re using a fire puffer, fill it up with air and don’t puff it out. Place it on the stair instead of a fan. As you do so, recite: “Here is the air that the mortal breathes.” On the second stair, place the glass of water.

As you do so, recite: “Here is the water that mortal drinks.”

On the third stair, place the handful of dirt. Try to spread it wide. As you do so, recite: “Here is the earth on which mortal stands.”

On the fourth stair, place the candle but don’t light it. Leave whatever you intend to light the candle with beside it. As you do so, recite: “Here is the fire that burns mortal’s hands.”

On the fifth stair, place the picture of your house from the past. As you do so, recite: “Here is the time that has come to pass.”

On the sixth stair, place the picture of your house as it is now, and roll the dice beside it. Pray that it does not come up a high number. As you do so, recite: “Here is the present and the die are cast.”

On the seventh stair, place one of your watches. As you do so, recite: “Here comes the future, the time ticks by now.”

On the eighth stair, place your food offering. As you do so, recite: “Here is the offering for Devil’s mouth.”

On the ninth stair, place the mirror. As you do so, recite: “Here is my image, in God’s likeness I trust.” [**Note, regardless of whether you are Christian or religious at all, you must recite this line as it is phrased here without any substitution, hesitance or reservations.]

On the tenth stair, place the ashes and the dust-bunnies. As you do so, recite: “Here is mortality, ashes and dust.”

On the eleventh stair, place your bug. Make sure it cannot get away. It must be alive. As you do so, recite: “Here is a life I present unto thee.”

On the twelfth and final stair, place the thing from your body. As you do so, recite: “And here is the essence extracted from me.”

Step on the top landing or the final stair and turn around. Draw a line of salt across the edge of the stair/landing. Recite simply: “No further than here.”

Next Morning

Now leave your objects overnight. On this night, you should not notice anything suspicious or concerning. If you do, abort the ritual by putting a circle of salt around each item and around your bed as well as anyone else’s bed in your house. Leave them for the night, and then remove the items the following morning. You must completely obliterate them all. If you do not notice anything suspicious or concerning and are able to get a good night’s sleep without any nightmares or without waking up until daybreak, the ritual is officially in effect and whenever you wish to, you may complete it. It will remain in effect as long as all of the items remain on the stairs. However, none of the items should be allowed to fall from their stair or to overlap into other stairs.

Do not allow the salt, dirt or the ashes and dust to spill over onto another stair. If you must, keep them in a container of some sort. The water must remain open to the air so be careful not to spill any of it. Do not leave anything besides these items on your stairs. In performing this ritual, you have banished any supernatural/demonic beings in your house to the first floor and they must get past the twelve curses you have set on your stairs before they can get to you. Believe me when I say, if they didn’t already despise you, they will now. Refrain from making unnecessary trips up and down your stairs after sundown as this weakens the curses. Depending on how strong your supernatural/demonic beings are, these curses might not hold more than a couple nights. As soon as you start to notice even the most subtly peculiar activity, immediately consider completing the ritual. This ritual CANNOT be reinforced by repeating it.

If you sleep on the first floor, do the ritual backwards, starting from the top of the stairs instead of the bottom. All the same rules apply. If you don’t have stairs in your house, you can do this same ritual in a long hallway as long as you can clearly see the twelve divisions. You may mark them with tape, lines of salt (which would create a stronger barrier) or pencil, or you can place a long thin piece of wood at regular intervals down the hallway. All the same rules apply. DO NOT perform this ritual in a room. DO NOT perform this ritual outside. DO NOT perform this ritual in any small enclosed space such as a tent or a car. (if it’s even possible for you to do that.)

Ritual in progress

To complete the ritual, it is advisable that you evacuate everyone else from your house. Have them stay the night in a hotel or something. You must do this alone. Stand in the exact place where you recited, “It is from here whenceforth I shall commence.” at exactly the same time when you originally recited this line when you initiated the ritual. Make sure you have your weapon in hand. You must stand there for the first hour, you must not move or be moved. Your feet must remain planted in place.

AS SOON AS the first hour ends, step onto the stair with the fan. Turn it on as quickly as possible and let it run across the stair. If you used a puffer, puff out the air that was inside it. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the second hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you. AS SOON AS the second hour ends, step onto the stair with the cup of water. Leave the fan running or make sure there is no air in the puffer. Drink the entire glass of water as quickly as possible. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the third hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the third hour ends, step onto the stair with the dirt. Your feet must both be within the pile of dirt that you threw on the stair. If you put the dirt in a container, dump it out onto the stair as wide as possible to give yourself more space to stand on. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the fourth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the fourth hour ends, step onto the stair with the candle on it and light it. You may stand beside it or hold it up to your face. Make sure it does not go out. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the fifth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the fifth hour ends, step onto the stair with the picture from long ago. Without turning around, you must use the candle from the last stair to burn the picture. Don’t blow out the flame until the picture has been turned into ash or at least until you cannot tell what the picture is of anymore. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the sixth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the sixth hour ends, step onto the stair with the picture of the present day. You must rip this picture as many times as the dice indicated without letting it fall apart. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the seventh hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the seventh hour ends, step onto the stair with the watch or small clock. You must turn the clock forward as many hours as the number on the dice. Do not turn it back to achieve the same number. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the eighth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the eighth hour ends, step onto the stair with the food offering. It may have been there for a few days so hopefully it hasn’t gone too bad. You must take a bite of it and swallow. You must eat it as if it is delicious even if it is disgusting. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the ninth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the ninth hour ends, step onto the stair with the mirror. Look into the mirror and look only at your face. DO NOT try to use the mirror to look behind you. No matter what you see in the mirror you must not look away. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the tenth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the tenth hour ends, smash the mirror and step onto the stair with the ashes and dust. You must drop a drop of blood onto them. It must be your blood and it must be fresh. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the eleventh hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the eleventh hour ends, step onto the stair with the bug. Kill the bug. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the twelfth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

AS SOON AS the twelfth hour ends, step onto the stair with the thing from your body. You must swallow it whole. You must not wash it down with anything. DO NOT move from that stair for the entirety of the thirteenth hour. Stand facing the top of the stairs. DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES turn around or look behind you.

As soon as the thirteenth and final hour ends, step onto the place where you recited: “No further than here.” Make sure you have your weapon in hand. Turn around and brace yourself. Good luck.

Smashing the mirror - 7 years bad luck?

    Make sure you have your weapon in hand. Turn around and brace yourself.

What the hell is that meant to mean?

I think its meant to be prepared of the demons attacking you, when the ritual did Not work properly. It also may be, that you are suposed to fight the demons themselve. If you dont want to try it yourself, Check out lupus creepus on yt. He has performed Many of These Rituals.

Rituals to Not Do: Listen to the Clock

If you want to lose your grasp on reality, and destroy your complete sanity, just listen to the clock. (This ritual does not belong to me!)

But this will not be easy, let me tell you right now. This is not something to mess around with. It's just an easy way to lose your mind within the confines of your own home. But there are a couple of guidelines to follow. First, pick a room with no windows.

It can be a room for anything, but it just can't have windows. Second, you can start at any time in the day, even if you wish to start at night, for the process will take exactly 24 hours to complete.

Third, cancel all appointments you have for that day, turn off your phone if you have to, for there can't be any distractions for you to focus on. Fourth, make sure it is a calm and quiet day outside, and not windy or storming outside. Lastly, to start the process, you must go into the room you picked, put a clock inside (the clock must make the distinct 'tick-tock' sound when every second passes), turn off the lights, and light a candle. That candle will be your only source of light.

Once you have done all of that, I honestly want you to ask yourself one question, "Do I really want to do this?" If your answer is yes, then may God have mercy on you. I'm here to merely prepare you on what to expect. Alright, let me tell you a little bit of information about the procedure. Back in the mid-1800's, radical members of the Christian, Muslim, and Islamic faith used it as a way to "connect" with God. It was kept under wraps due to its extreme nature and unusual method to connect with the supernatural.

During the procedure, they would have been in constant prayer and worship, but would eventually stop due to the events that would happen afterwards. The clock represented life on earth, and how short it can be, and the candle represented God as the only way of guidance through life. More often than not, each person that would go through the procedure, would lose their minds and within a day and due to their insane actions, would kill themselves from what they claim to have seen. But if you were one of the lucky ones, you can keep your sanity, like me. Okay, now here is what to expect:

The first 3 hours are the least eventful, mainly because nothing really happens, but prepare yourself in these hours. These are the only hours in which you may choose to leave the procedure.

In the 4th hour, you will not be able to escape by any means. The lock on your door will lock by itself and you will have no methods to move it.

In the 5th hour, you will start to sweat profusely, and will start to have feelings of anxiety. You will start to look behind you many times, and every time, there will be nothing there.

In the 6th hour, you will hear noises. Not noises from the house or from outside, but thuds and thumps throughout the hour in ten minute intervals, with each noise getting louder.

In the 7th hour, you will pass out, and dream. But this will be the only pleasant hour throughout the process. You will dream about the best moments in your life. Every great accomplishment, wonderful memory, and friends you have made will appear before you. It will have been the best dream you have ever had in your life. Even events from the future can appear.

At the beginning of the 8th hour, you shall wake up. But when you do, you will feel an extreme sense of elation and comfort, similar the effects of smoking marijuana. Now, for some this could be considered another pleasant hour, due to the feeling of the drug, but what comes after will be the start of your suffering.

In the 9th hour, you will, in a sense, go from one drug, to another. Your feelings of happiness will change to that of extreme adrenaline and energy, similar to the effects of any stimulant drug. But a warning, you must try your hardest to keep yourself under control. You're unpredictable, there is no telling what you will do in this state.

In the 10th hour, you hopefully have had minimal injuries from the last hour. But now you will start to feel normal, and your feelings you previously felt will subside. Now you will hear screaming, but the screaming can vary from what it sounds like, from a little girl to a full-grown man. You will hear screaming at six minute intervals throughout the hour. This hour is going to feel like an eternity to pass.

At the 11th hour, the light from the candle will go out. That's it. You are left alone in the darkness. You are free to think to yourself, most likely regretting the decision you have made.

At the 12th hour, the light from the candle will reappear. But do not worry, this is another hour of silence. But mentally prepare yourself for what you about to experience next.

In the 13th hour, you shall pass out much like you did in the 7th hour. But don't expect happy memories. In this dream, you shall experience every painful heart-wrenching moment, suffering, and unpleasant things in your life all over again. Even suffering in the future, including your own death. This will be the worst dream you will ever have in your life.

At the 14th hour, you will wake up. This is another hour of silence. But the silence will be broken by your own sobbing. Your tears shall continue until the hour is over.

In the 15th hour, putting it very bluntly, is when things start to get weird. You will talk to someone. He's not visible, but he is there. He doesn't have a name, but I'm giving him one. He is your guardian angel, but you can call him 'Watcher' or 'Protector'. But for me, I call him 'Asshole'. This may seem funny, but trust me, it suits him. The first thing he will say to you is "Ask me anything, and I shall give you an answer." You can ask him anything about your life, what will happen in the future, and why events occurred when they did. He will give you an answer, but in extreme and graphic details, and give reasons for things you will not understand, whether it be a tragedy or a death. By the end of the hour, he will say "Farewell" and leave.

In the 16th hour, you will talk to your parents. But they do not make a physical appearance, mind you. Now it's your turn to answer questions. They will ask you questions about what you have done with your life, and if you do not answer one of their questions, they will press on for an answer until you can't take it anymore. At the end of the hour, they will go away.

At the 17th hour, you will talk to the most important guy in your life, whether it be your significant other or your best friend. He will ask you why and how you became friends. But keep in mind, he is not looking for friendly conversation, he is questioning your friendship with him. Finding every mistake you have done to cripple your friendship with him. Reasoning with him will not work, and he will act like your parents did in the previous hour.

At the 18th hour, you will speak to the most important girl in your life, whether it be your significant other or your best friend. She will do the same as the person in the 17th hour did, and ask the same questions.

At the 19th hour, you will talk with yourself. Meaning you will talk with your future self, and trust me, this is the least pleasant conversation. He will tell you things you will not want to hear about yourself, and will ask you questions you can and can't answer. Soon it will be too much, and you will find yourself screaming at yourself, and anger and self-loathing will be the only emotion you will have.

In the 20th hour, following the events of the 19th hour, you will find any possibility to hurt yourself. Self-inflicting pain will be constant in this hour. Some have even committed suicide.

In the 21st hour, if you managed to survive the previous hour, here is what will await you. Music. Yes, music. It will be soft orchestral music, with a choir singing Gregorian Chant, similar to church music, but more beautiful. By the end of this hour, your wounds will heal. Don't ask me why, even I don't know.

In the 22nd hour, the music will stop. This is another hour of silence. But you have time to think to yourself. The light on the candle will change colors, all colors of the spectrum. This is quite a sight to behold, but it's almost soothing.

In the 23rd hour, you will sing Gregorian Chant. But your singing will be the only sound in the room. You honestly don't know what you’re singing, but it sounds beautiful, and you will actually want to sing more.

Finally, the 24th hour. This is the most interesting hour. Rumor says you talk to God himself, but here is how it goes. You are pinned to the floor by some unknown force, and someone or something asks you a question at ten minute intervals.

Questions like "Are you happy?" or "Would you like to change?" You must answer, you will feel the need to. The questioner sounds like a man, but at the same time sounds like an animal. Almost like the roar of a lion. His voice is terrifying but yet comforting at the same time. After the hour is up you will be able to get up from the floor, and the door will unlock. If you're lucky, you still have your sanity.

Now it is up to you what you shall do with this information. If you want to do this, I'm not stopping you, but I'm giving you fair warning. Some things are beyond the realms of human comprehension and sometimes we just have nothing to explain the unnatural. But whatever it is, at least we know we are not alone. Now remember what I have told you. If you want to lose your grasp on reality, and destroy your complete sanity, just listen to the clock.

I would say that anything goes here, but with the implied freedom that anyone can question it too. Posting stuff that's taken from creepypasta sites doesn't lend itself much to credibility. Additionally, it's written as if it was a 4chan spoopy story.

Edit: Although the sidebar does specify that questioning it is kind of forbidden now that I read it, so I'm apparently in the wrong here. Either way, I don't see any harm in noting if it's a rip-off from another site.

I suggest that for this hour you focus your thoughts and energies on positive intent rather than diverting your attention elsewhere. Bringing in an object may interfere with the ritual. Should you choose to bring something, make it small. Do not bring technology (phone, DS, etc.)

This is a noteworthy ritual, except for its few faults: Not everyone is a Muslim or a Christian, so it kind of implies that not everyone can do this(don't see why anyone would wanna do it in the first place, and it feels like that to me, it may not be so for you.) As someone in the comments mentioned, Islam and Muslim are the same faith, Muslims are followers of the Islam faith The part of the "You will hear the Gregorian chant" Again, a bit too much specific, even for an example. A more ambiguous sentence would increase the power of the ritual, I feel. All in all, a pretty interesting one, and of course, that means: I ain't gonna do it, ever!

The Starry Guide [RECIPE]

So, this is a ritual that I read about on a music blog of all places about two years ago. I remember seeing it pinned to the top of the blog with a title in all caps declaring it to be the "MOST IMPORTANT SELF-EXPLORATION PROCEDURE EVER", and being immediately intrigued. It was a ritual that involved you going to sleep in a dimly lit room and awaking to find yourself completely immersed in an alternate reality where you and your "guide" were the sole inhabitants. I read the entire post (which, to be frank, was very poorly written; the author went off on tangents nearly every other sentence, and I had to read it three times before I had an idea of what to do), and even got set to try the ritual before feeling a little bit scared and overwhelmed, so I never attempted it. Until this July.

I was cleaning out my room (which I hadn't done in forever, really) and I found an old notebook from my freshman year of high school. I flipped through looking at some of the doodles I had drawn and the little notes and jokes I would draw to show my friends that sat next to me, and eventually stumbled on the page where I had written down a bulleted form of the information on that music blog. I had totally forgotten about "The Starry Guide". I went online to try and find the blog that had posted the experiment, but couldn't remember for the life of me what is was called, or if it even still existed (if any of you think you know what I'm talking and could help me find it, it was a music forum for bedroom punk artists, I think the name had something to do with fireworks, I cannot remember at all). For some reason, I was absolutely fascinated with this experiment now more than ever, and so I decided to try it that night. And then the next night. And the night after that. Since then, I have gone back for about 30 more sessions. This ritual has literally changed my life, and now I am going to give you all the opportunity to have this unbelievable experience yourself.

Before we get started, I should let you know that if you go into this with a closed mind, you will suffer severe consequences. If you go in expecting anything in particular or are only hoping for one specific outcome of this ritual, this may likely be one of the most emotionally draining and perhaps damaging experiences you ever expose yourself to in your entire lifetime. You must go in curious and cautious, but also with a clear and steady mind if you want to get answers.

INGREDIENTS:

1. A room with at least 1 window

2. Something to cover the window (Obviously you don't need anything if you have curtains)

3. A clock (Digital or mechanical)

4. A bed

5. A pillow

6. 3 lamps

7. Something to use to dampen the lamps (for example, a bedsheet. I have found that lampshades do not work as well as something you can tie around the lamp completely.)

8. Something you hold very dear to yourself that you can fit COMPLETELY UNDER THE PILLOW. This could be anything -- a picture of your parents, a doll you loved as a child, this part is completely up to you. But we aware that depending on what you pick, your conversations will be much different than if you chose another item.

ESSENTIAL INFORMATION:

    Planning the night of your session(s) is absolutely essential. Do NOT plan it on a night where it is supposed to thunderstorm or pour rain/hail/snow, this could result in a bad session and an agitated guide/warped alt-reality. Also do not plan on doing your first few sessions on a night where you are feeling any strong negative emotions, such as anger, fear, or sadness. In fact, plan on doing your first sessions when you are rather joyful or confident in the experience, as the first time can be incredibly overwhelming for a visitor who is not in a good state of mind.

    The sun must be either in the process of setting (within an hour of dusk) or completely set when you begin your set-up for the night.

    Make sure that all electronics in your room are unplugged, besides the lamps and your clock, if need be. I recommend putting on brand new lightbulbs on the lamps if possible (I wrote in my journal that a bulb dying or going out in the middle of your sessions could lead to serious consequences, but I didn't note what those consequences are, unfortunately). The clock just needs to be working prior to your transition into the Starry Realm, if it stops working before you fall asleep, you will simply drift to sleep without transitioning. Do not worry about the possibility of your clock breaking or stopping during your session; this is no problem and has happened to me before.

    DO NOT TOUCH THE BED AT ALL UNTIL YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.

You are now ready for the set-up. This is the precursor to actually entering the Starry Realm, and requires you to follow a strict order of operations, so please, do not try to do it in your "own way"; if you do manage to transition on your own terms, you may anger your guide.

THE SET-UP:

1. Start by setting the clock anywhere in the room that you cannot READ IT when you lay down on the bed. DO NOT LAY IN BED TO TRY AND FIGURE THIS OUT. Just take an estimated guess; for example, if you set a digital clock on the floor next to the bed, odds are, you will not be able to see it. Or, if you hang up a mechanical clock on the wall behind your head, you probably will not be able to read the time, so that would also be completely fine (seeing the clock itself is fine if you can't make out what time it is).

2. Next, cover the windows to the best of your ability. Again, it's okay if a little bit of light shines through, as long as the light doesn't hit your face.

3. Now, turn off all of the lights in the room. Have your clock already turned on, and note the exact hour and minute of the time you flick the switch to turn to the lights off. It is okay if all little bit of light leaks in from under the door, just make sure the door is firmly shut and the only sources of light that are inside of the room come from your lamps and clock (if you are using a digital clock).

4. Plug in the first lamp. Position it on the floor TO THE LEFT OF WHERE YOU WILL LAY YOUR HEAD.

5. Plug in the second lamp. Position it on the floor AT THE END OF THE BED WHERE YOUR FEET REST.

6. Plug in the third lamp. Position it on the floor TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE YOU WILL LAY YOUR HEAD.

NOTE FOR STEPS 4-6: YOU MUST DO IT FROM LEFT TO END OF BED TO RIGHT!

7. Now, find the personal object you chose for this session without knocking over your lamps and clock (I keep mine in my pocket during the set-up to avoid this). Place it under your pillow.

8. Now, set the clock to exactly an hour before the time you had flipped the light switch.

9. You may now lie down in the bed and go to sleep. You have an hour to drift to sleep before you miss your transition frame into the Starry Realm.

THE SESSIONS:

Once you awaken, you will realize that the door to your room stands open. You will be able to very clearly see the outline of a man standing in the door. Do not move from the bed until he has beckoned you. Once he has, get up, and approach him; DO NOT LOOK AT HIS FACE AS YOU GET CLOSER. Hand him the object you chose; he will put in his pocket before turning to lead you through wherever it is you are doing the ritual; FOLLOW HIM THROUGH EVERY ROOM HE ENTERS. Never try to get in front of him, and NEVER TRY TO GET A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE. It is unknown why he refuses to show you his face, but you will never see him from any angle but from behind. It is extremely likely this man will look familiar to you, but you won't be able to put a finger on it. DO NOT ASK HIM WHO HE IS. He will likely disclose this information to you in later sessions regardless, and asking him will only make him angry. It seems that depending on the personal object you use, some of the physical gestures and attire he is wearing seems to be similar to that of the person or people that your object links to for you personally, if that makes any sense (for example, if you choose a baseball card your grandfather bought for you, he might have the same accent as your grandfather, or wear the same hat as him).

Your relationship with this man will greatly affect what kind of sessions you have. If you bother him or anger him, you will likely have sessions that induce feelings of unbearable fear and terror. If you answer all of his questions honestly and do as you're told, you will have more control over the direction your sessions take. The Guide will often show you scenes of your future and tell you how to rectify any of the mistakes you have made, and how to move on from anything that may be causing you any emotional or physical pain if you listen to him and give him all your trust.

You will also quickly realize the Starry Realm is a mirror image of reality. The only difference is you and the Guide are the only individuals on this plane, and the sky seems to be lighted with millions of stars, although the Guide has suggested that they might not truly be stars. All of your neighbors' homes will be exactly as they were the exact moment you drifted to sleep and transitioned, but there has never been a sighting of another human being. I noted in my notebook that one user reported seeing a squirrel in one of his sessions, and that the Guide was furious about it and it quickly turned into the worst session he's ever had.

The Guide is known to do whatever it takes to make you feel comfortable to an extent. If you are feeling intimidated with the environment, or the Guide is not talking to you as much as you'd like, try to encourage conversation by telling him something about you. Maybe suggest going to a certain place, or going to a certain place that you feel like would make you more comfortable. The Guide's purpose is to help you regain contact with yourself, and although he does everything he does for a reason, he will always do what it takes to help you find what you are looking for.

If and when he stops walking, it means the session is over. He will start to turn back towards you. CLOSE YOUR EYES COMPLETELY. You will hear him approach you, and maybe even touch you. He will either tell you he looks forward to your next session, in which case just keep your eyes closed and you will awake in reality in no time, or he will ask you if you "found what you were looking for". If he asks you that, it means he does not wish to speak to you again, because either he truly feels you do not need to see him anymore, or because you have angered or annoyed him. If you respond no, you have pretty much a 100% chance of having a bad session next time you decide to travel. It is unknown what happens if you say yes; I don't know if anyone has ever responded that way.

Do not visit him every night, as this could anger him. Try to make two or three visits a week at most to keep from bothering from him.

I would love to hear your stories. Please be careful and heed all of my warnings. Thank you for reading, and happy travelling!

In my experience, the guide is not necessarily friendly, but he is not mean, either. And we've had some good conversations before (I think I even made him chuckle once).

And I would say do it at your own risk: I struggle with depression, anxiety, and PTSD, yet I still find the experience to be very nice.

No problem at all! This is a pretty weird ritual, I'm aware, so if you have any problem or concerns, you can totally ask me :)

In complete honesty, I was terrified when I initially emerged and saw the Guide in the doorway, because he looked so human, if that makes any sense. I expected him to look like the cartoony image in my head, and instead, he was another man standing in my home with no way of telling who he was. That combined with the tense 5-10 minutes of waiting for the beckoning was overwhelming, but after he led me through my home and took me outside, the sky amazed me. It was the most beautiful thing I have seen in my life. From there, my fear dissipated, and when he spoke, I just answered confidently. I really couldn't wait to go back.

Thank you. So it would take a while to be beckoned?

I feel like I wouldn't see him because of how my bed is positioned, haha. I guess I could always sleep in a different position, though.

Thanks for the answers. I'll ask you any further questions I have in the future.

What I have found is the more unsure about the experience you are, the longer it takes to be beckoned. My first session it felt like an hour past before he finally beckoned. My most recent session it seemed he beckoned me as soon as I transitioned.

Alright, thanks! That's a really great tip.

So, is it okay to bring something with us that is comforting? For example, if I have a charmed bag or special protection necklace I like to wear because it makes me feel more secure and psychically protected, is it okay if I bring that or should I leave it? I think I'd be okay with leaving it, but it would make me feel safer and more secure.

Alright, thank you so much. I have super bad anxiety, so I find holding a small crystal greatly eases it.

I'll have to find a time to do this ritual. It could be anywhere from a few days from now to several weeks. I'm already feeling less anxious and more excited! :) I'll make sure I post my experience(s) when they happen.

Hi, /u/ChurroMooCow ! I just wanted to ask two things. Can we hear some of your stories? If it's cool with you, that'd be awesome. Also, I wanted to ask if it specified that two people can do it at once or be with eachother during the time that you're with the guide. Thanks!

This sounds like a very simple and interesting ritual. Thanks for sharing. Could you clarify what you mean about the Guide suggesting how the stars "are not truly stars"? That sounds interesting; do they symbolize something?

Also, if you make the Guide angry, is there any way to change his feelings about you? I would be slightly nervous about him not liking me if it ends up that way, especially if the Guide gets angry about things you can't control, like the squirrel in the story.

Sorry, last questions. Is the beckoning a physical hand motion, or does he speak to you? Is the Guide always a different person, or is he the same entity but in different forms?

I don't know what the "stars" truly are. He mentioned something in passing, I can't remember what, that suggested they may not be stars, but he never said, "those are not stars". I have been wondering what the hell he meant by that, but I just can't seem to figure it out.

The way I have learned to calm him down is to stay cool when he is angry and just remind myself that I am in control, and that he is supposed to help me, not the other way around, and he seems to respond to those types of thoughts positively.

The beckoning is a physical gesture; it appears to be "frame for frame" the exact same gesture every time. You won't miss it.

The Guide, in my experience, is the same man in different attire depending on the object I use or the way I am feeling in general.

Interesting. This seems like something I could try. However, I have one question: my bed is a loft in the left hand corner of the room. How would I set up the lamp at the foot of my bed, then?

Hmm. That could be slightly problematic... I'm not exactly sure. Is there any place you could wedge the lamp? Maybe between a bedframe and the wall?

I don't know, it sounds rather unsafe to try it that way. I'd say find another bed to use if possible. Or use a couch!

So, you don't ACTUALLY wake up in this, do you? I have other people living in my house but would love to try this. I don't want the session to go awry because the Guide finds out about other people, or if the other people in my house wake up.

No you do not. As long as no one wakes you up in the middle (this would be very bad) or touches the lamps, clock, etc. (this would also be bad) then you should be completely fine.

I'm not sure how drugs would effect your experiences, I have never used any substances or alcohol in my life so I really can't give you a good answer on that one. I'd say as long as you aren't under the influence of substances when you go to bed it would probably be okay, but again, I could be completely wrong and maybe you shouldn't try this ritual... Sorry!

I read this a bit late, but I have a few questions.

    So the sessions basically helped you emotionally?

    When you saw the future in your sessions, did it come true later?

    Were the sessions in a dream? Or would you literally wake up in another reality?

Old-Fashioned Teleportation - much better than todays new-fangled teleportation! Multiple players.

How To Teleport, The Old Fashioned Way [RECIPE]

You’ll need a few things of course. Water, a plastic basin and blood.

Water has to be pure, or clean enough to see through will do (for short distances that is and if you don’t mind risking to lose a toe or two). In short the more pure the water the safer the travel.

And you’ll need something to put the water in. A plastic basin is not ideal but that’s the one you can always find anywhere so. Of course the ideal matter for holding the water is silver because silver is the most permeable and sterile element and -not everyone knows this but- is also the most protective one that you can actually find and afford.

The protective aspect of it I’m talking about is, you know that you’ve probably seen a lot of silverware or silver trinkets at your grandma’s house that have been passed down to her from her grandparents. Silver has a way of retaining energy and it gets exponentially stronger and bind to your family blood –if your family have had them for more than 50 years -.

So if you have antique silverware or trinkets you could just melt them and create a makeshift basin (also it’s important to note here that silver objects have to have been at your family’s possession for all its lifetime – it doesn’t count before the time it was processed and shaped into the shape it has now though-.

If you do not know the origin of the silver objects you possess, I suggest you do not use them for teleportation for they are generally filled with different energies from different bloodlines and that causes that pent up energy to be very unstable – and possibly full of dark energy at this point because energies are much like DNA’s they’re each to their own and they refuse to get together with other energies so it creates a rift- that you won’t want to use for dematerilisation and rematerilisation of your atoms. I know plastic sounds shit compared to silver after this but trust me it’ll get the job done.

The last but –oh boy- certainly not the least ingredient for a decent home-made teleportation is blood. Blood is literally the life it needs to actually work. Now I’m not suggesting you to sacrifice any innocent animal and drink or bathe in their blood. I mean family blood and of course again not suggesting any unsolicited blood donations from your relatives. I can’t stress that enough but It has to be consensual. Oh and yeah you need something to put the blood in as well.

The actual process takes a bit longer than you’d might think. Actually it took us nearly 2 hours the first time to get ourselves 3 blocks away. So without further ado here’s how you do it:

First step: Blood has to come from a lot of different relatives so start by asking your cousins that are roughly same age as you. Because the chances of you convincing older adults to do this is very slim so stick to the younger ones. Also younger ones tend to obey very easily when you give orders.

Second step: Gather the ingredients and pick somewhere spacious that you won’t be bothered. Ideal setting for a great teleportation is anywhere you can be with nature. A river bank would be great because it also covers the water.

Third step: Form a circle and choose a leader. It’s imperative that the leader must be the most resolved and determined one in the circle. It’s also important to mention that leader has to be the one who is open to anything- good or evil- and has to possess the most imaginative faculties and creative power among you so choose wisely. Their mind is what’s going to carry your physical bodies into spiritual world -for a split second- and back into physical world again. Thus they have to be level-headed.

If your leader is a mindless douche-bag who is not respectful for the whole process and the lives at stake, you could face with grave consequences and death would be the least of them. The place where the leader carries your bodies from material world to the spiritual one before they are zapped back to the material world again, is a very volatile very dangerous place. I don’t know exactly what’s going on in there however I do know that it is a timeless place and there are entities of absolute evil that dwell there that shouldn’t see you and vice versa. If you become known to them they would turn your and your family’s lives a living hell, I can attest to that unfortunately.

Fourth step: Fill the plastic or silver basin with water and put your bare feet in it. Make sure the basin is wide enough so everyone’s feet can fit in.

Fifth step: Draw a little amount of blood from everyone to fill ¾ of a cup. Mix it thoroughly and give the cup to the leader because they have to protect it for all costs now. The leader should hold the cup in their dominant hand and then open their non-dominant hand and touch the cup with the palm of that hand.

Sixth step: Everyone should now recite a prayer for protection. The prayer could be from any religion, the important thing is that it has to mentally and psychically prepare all of you for the journey. Also imagining a protective force field around you would be very helpful.

Seventh step: The leader now should clear their mind and envision the place they want to go. Closing the eyes would definitely help at this stage because the leader has to stay focused during the whole thing. They should try to forget where they are and imagine they are in the desired place. I should advise you that your first destination should be somewhere within a roughly 1 mile radius from your current location because farther locations require more experience and skill.

Eighth step: Leader would sense if they are near or not. Because dematerilisation process of the bodies feels almost like an orgasm to the leader. Yes you read that right. Except that dematerilisation is a full body orgasm and get exponentially more intense if there are more relatives joining in. I know it’s awful to think about getting an orgasm while your family is present. However, don’t worry they won’t even notice your orgasm face when you safely rematerilize everyone to the desired location.

A reminder for the group: You should clear your thoughts and let your leader do the thinking. You should not be thinking anything other than your desired destination because any stray thoughts would prolong the process and even get you maimed. Shout out to my stupid cousin who tried to reach his phone to see who was calling him during the teleportation and lost half of his left arm.

A reminder for the leader: Leaders, the 90% of the work is on your shoulders. You have to be both the carriage and the bridge to the other side for your family. So try to take deep breaths and enjoy the ride.

A word of caution for everyone: Teleportation is not a game. Please do not try to perform teleportation alone or with anyone whom you are not related, because at the end teleportation is a conversion of energy and you have to have steady hands to guide the transformation of the energy and for that your family blood is what gives you power and keeps you grounded.

Safe travels everyone!

Why does everyone ALWAYS leave out the last step? In this case, it's step 9: Make sure James Randi is there, observing under controlled conditions so that you and the family can split a cool million and you'll also get a Nobel prize for solving the problem of direct point to point transport. Don't tell me no one is interested in that million dollars.
Again, I have to point out I'm not breaking the rules here. I'm not saying this isn't real, I'm just genuinely interested in why people seem so disinterested in the money and fame that would come from proving this stuff real in a scientifically controlled setting.

One part of it is because at this point it's been proven that James Randi is as fraudulent as the individuals who he tried and expose. Another is because when you get to that level of magic, you're no longer thinking like a normal human. Why should you care about something as worthless as paper when you have the power to shape the world at your fingertips?

James Randi is a fraud? I haven't made any claim about the validity of this teleportation ritual, but now you have made a fact claim. Please provide citation that James Randi is fraudulent.
Also, I don't see how the ability to teleport a few city blocks after hours of apparently dangerous ceremony informs an instant disregard for recognition and wealth. Do you have contempt for honest inquiry?

Well how about I cite his selection process. James Randi and James Randi alone gets to decide who gets to take the challenge and can cancel that appointments any time he sees fit. He's been known to cancel sessions with people because he believed that they were scientifically impossible even before testing. So already he's let personal bias completely destroy the accuracy of his results. Not to mention he changed his policy at a later point so that only the most famous spiritualists could attempt it.

And that's not even going into the many many cases of individuals, like Rupert Sheldrake, who have come out saying that James Randi straight up lied. You could pass at least some of those up as butthurt psychics who were exposed, but it still warrants consideration.

What indication did I give that I was against honest inquiry? Do you have contempt for honest attempts to explain awnsers to your questions?

I merely stated that your looking at this whole magic thing from the standpoint of a normal person. Magic is all about serperating yourself from the norm, so individuals who use it will not be thinking like normal members of society. It's like being on drugs. You're not making the same decisions as others.

Teleportation won't mess you up that bad (hopefully) but the more you get invested in magic the more it's going to change your personality. Like I said before, those who get invested in magical acts don't feel a need for money or wealth. Why? Because to them it's worthless paper, and the real goal should be things like power and domination over others. Money is only worth something if you want what it can get you (material goods) and more often than not magic users are focused on getting other items.

James Randi is a guy with limited resources, including time and personnel. He literally can't agree to personally test everyone, and some claims are so thoroughly debunked that he can reasonably reject them at their face, like cold reading experts 'contacting the dead,' so that's a very poor indication that he's a fraud.
You seem to misunderstand how bias factors in to science. Declaring something impossible doesn't make it impossible any more than declaring something possible makes it possible, so James Randi saying something is scientifically impossible is likely based on prior evidence. Provide specific examples if you want to convince me otherwise.

You also claim that selecting for the most well known psychics is a problem. What other criteria should be used for determining the legitimacy of claims? Wouldn't the most effective and expert psychics have the highest success rate and gather the greatest fame and regard?

Rupert Sheldrake's complaint has been refuted, so that is also a poor example. It turns out that the JRF keeps records of their interactions with claimed psychics and the complaint was that James Randi lied about a video of a dog failing to exhibit psychic powers. The source video in question was never actually provided to James Randi and he admitted he was going off of the evaluation of students of a colleague. For some reason Sheldrake refused to allow Randi to see the video, never published it and didn't want to recreate the experiment for Randi to evaluate. Indeed, I know of no credible complaint that doesn't fall apart under scrutiny.

And yes, I have contempt for your brand of 'honesty', since to me it signals the precise opposite.
As for the personal motivations for avoiding scientific scrutiny, are you sure it isn't because 'bad vibes' make magic stop working for some reason? If you have intimate knowledge of the kind of power you indicate, I spot several logical flaws with that. First, you care what a random skeptic says on the internet despite not caring about a million dollars. Second, you haven't used magic to force me to believe the things you do, instead relying on sophistry.
And if you don't have that power yourself, then we're back on the same level, relying on the same standard of evidence, which you have failed to provide, so neither of us would have a better reason to believe that magical claims are true.

    James Randi is one guy with limited resources, including time.

I understand that. Truly I do. Which is the main reason why I feel using him as the prime example of disproving magic is complete BS. He's about as accurate as an average person. Probably less so since he went into the business with the intention of debunking things, which means he'll likely intentionally overlook results he doesn't agree with.

    Some claims are so thoroughly debunked

Doesn't matter. If you act like that and reject objectivity (no matter how ridiculous it might seem) then you open yourself to human bias. And at that point it turns into one guy trying to one up the people he's "debunking" for his own amusement and to poorly prove a point. How do we know he isn't pushing away the more reasonable spiritualists and cherry picking the crazies with that methodology?

I was just using Sheldrake as an example. Honestly it's going to be hard to cite any concrete evidence because every claim a victims makes Randi is going to make a counterclaim. Since neither side really keeps a record of such things and because Randi is not nearly transparent enough it complicates things. I don't know who is wrong or right in these issues but there's enough of a pattern to warrant at least some investigation. That's all I meant.

    JRF keeps records of their interactions

I'm sure they do. And I'm also sure that's a terrible way to go about things for credibility purposes. Why exactly aren't they leaving that to an unobjective third party?

    And yes I have contempt for your brand of "honesty", since to me it signals the precise opposite.

So according to this logic because I provided an awnser to the question you asked I somehow am a dishonest person? If you're going to reject the answer of every person who comes to you off hand then why bother asking? In fact, why even bother talking to you?

    As for the personal motivations of avoiding scientific scrutiny, are you sure it isn't because 'bad vibes' make magic stop working for some reason?

Some people think that. Personally I think that's BS. The main reason is because most magic users are an overly suspicious group of people who also are wary of getting into arguments with non believers who spend more time calling them ridiculous than actually trying to understand why they reached those conclusions.

Then there's the whole magic messes with you psychologically thing I mentioned before. And not to mention the bad experiences some of the more powerful practitioners have had being forcibly coopted into groups against their will. I've had a lot of issues with that myself. Do you really think that the people who can do this stuff are just going to advertise that? Imagine the security nightmare that would entail.

The human race is not nice to those who are different from others. We have a nasty habit of ostracizing people who we don't understand. Just look at how we treat the mentally ill.

Apologies, I'm sure you were writing your response while I edited mine. I actually preemptively addressed many of your points after initially posting it. A bad habit of mine.

I'll respond to the new points, starting with my insistence on your strident dishonesty. You came in with a preconception, not me. I admit that this ritual may work as described, since I haven't personally tested it. You claim James Randi is a fraud. Not 'an average person,' a fraud.
I refute that assertion and you stick to it without evidence. He is a very honest person and he comes up with testing conditions by consensus of himself and the test subject, and if you can tell me anything about any specific test that spoils objectivity, besides James Randi's assumed conclusions, it doesn't count as evidence. The tests work as designed whether conducted by a skeptic or true believer, an accredited expert or highschool dropout, so the reliability is in the tests themselves. Agreed?

Calling the refuted psychics victims is also dishonest. Psychic frauds and, in the case of those investigated by James Randi, proven frauds are not the victims. They often psychologically and emotionally manipulate actual victims for fame and monetary gain, so disabusing people of their undeserved veneer of credibility is, in my assessment, an act of kindness.

    You came in with a preconception, not me.

How is providing an explanation your question a preconception? I didn't even so much as comment on the rituals validity so that has nothing to do with this convo. All you've stated in this argument is a collection of biased opinions and every time I make a point you sweep it aside by changing the subject and focusing on the weaker aspects of my argument. Don't think I didn't notice that. I've seen that tactic used before and it seriously bugs me.

    He is a very honest person

That's an opinion and one not backed up with much evidence one way or the other. Honestly I shouldn't have gotten into this argument because, as I said before, there not enough transparency (which is probably the biggest issue with his test) to decide one way or another. Personally my gut tells me Randi is a fraud just like his gut would probably tell him I was a fraud. But you're right that I shouldn't have been so opinionated.

    The tests work as designed whether conducted by a skeptic or true believer, an accredited expert or highschool dropout, so the reliability is in the tests themselves. Agreed?

Except there's not enough transparency to confirm this one way or the other. So not agreed but not disagreeing. More of a the reliability of these tests have never been authenticated by third parties so they really shouldn't be used as the Golden standard but hey they could be legit but probably not sort of agreement.

    They often psychologically and emotionally manipulate actual victims for fame and monetary gain, so disabusing people of their undeserved veneer of credibility is, in my assessment, an act of kindness.

And you say I went into this with preconceptions. You're going to declare someone guilty without even giving them a fair trial? Just because James Randi is rich and famous and they're not. Bill Cosby would love you.

You claimed James Randi is a fraud without evidence. That is a preconception. I actually hold that people are presumed honest until they demonstrate dishonesty. Yes, you fall squarely in that category.

I'll admit some bias due to having never seen any reliable evidence to support any supernatural claim, but it's fallacious to declare my argument invalid for that reason. I am willing to objectively assess real evidence that is presented for evaluation.

Transparency means explaining how a test is to be done, what measurements, formulas or equipment is to be used and to make a prediction based on the parameters of the test. James Randi's experiments do not have a transparency issue, that is YET ANOTHER disparaging assertion that you have made which does not hold up to scrutiny.

And sure, perhaps if you make special exceptions for why a given phenomena is unfalsifiable, then James Randi's tests don't prove the phenomena false. They also consistently fail to prove any of the claims TRUE, which to me is the more important part.

And no, I don't declare people to be frauds without good reason, unlike you.

Listen. I've seen this trap sprung more times than I can count. If I fail the honesty test then you absolutely flunked it. You've provided even less evidence in this argument than I have, you've avoided addressing and continue avoiding addressing some of my earlier points, and you've personally attacked me and my authenticity with zero explanation even on prodding.

Does this sound familiar? Person asks a question. Second person makes an assertion based on questions parameters. First person makes counterclaim with zero evidence and then demands other person shows evidence. When asked to provide evidence of their own first person attempts to do so while struggling to fend off first persons claims with zero evidence because the first person says they don't need any because they're not making assertions. Despite all good debaters knowing that both parties need to provide evidence for their claims.

I'm just gonna skip all that.

    James Randi's experiments do not have a transparency issue, that is YET ANOTHER disparaging assertion that you have made which does not hold up to scrutiny.

And yet another claim you've made with zero evidence. I listed some evidence regarding this already which you ignored, but if you would like me to continue I can. Though I doubt you'll listen.

    I am willing to objectively assess real evidence that is presented for evaluation.

Considering how little objectivity you've shown during this conversation I really really doubt that. I can even cite examples too!

    Transparency means explaining how a test is to be done, what measurements, formulas or equipment is to be used and to make a prediction based on the parameters of the test.

I'd argue that's more common scientific procedure than transparency. Transperancy would be things like having a third part record all discourse between test giver and test subject. Demonstrating the existence of the prize money to the general public. Etc.

    And no, I don't declare people to be frauds without good reason, unlike you.

No. You do the opposite. You put people on a pedestal of authenticity with no good reason.

As I mentioned this in the post, first you gotta start with short distances and work your way up to longer ones like travelling between cities in the same continent. I strongly advise against using this for travelling between different continents. It doesn't matter how many silver objects you have, continental teleport could potentially fry up your leader's brains.

Interesting question. I have not used any electronics during the process for fear of the fact that the electromagnetic radiation they emit could interfere with the whole process and this could potentially lead you to rematerialize somewhere else entirely or even worse not rematerialize at all and get stuck in between. However if you really wanna try it with electronics present, do it at your own risk and if you actually survive afterwards come here and share your experience.

11 Miles Ritual - freaked out by Father? Want to save yourself the Hooded Man's cab fare? Try driving in your car. 1 player. Requires car.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]4 years ago
[RECIPE] Recipe for the 11 miles ritual in text below copied from the Creepypasta wikia website. I am not aware of its true origin. I would love to hear about any of your experiences with it

''Do you have something that you truly, relentlessly desire? Despite your state of life, is there something else that you would go completely to the end of the world to get? Well lucky for you, there's a way to achieve what you're looking for, and you won't need to go to the end of the world to get it. But you will need to go somewhere, and the place may be too out of reach for some. It's not far away, closer than one may believe but there're requirements that some individuals may not meet.

First, whatever it is that you seek, know that you must seriously desire what you want. In your eyes, it should be something you need. If you begin the journey without the correct state of mind, you will surely fail, as it will be near impossible to turn back once the journey starts. The second requirement is that you will need a vehicle of sorts. Most use a car, as it's the most comfortable choice. There have been a select few that have used small motorized vehicle, such as an ATV or motorcycle, but this has proven to be quite difficult, as the conditions of the journey can prove to be too bothersome.

Do not use a vehicle too large or noticeable, as you will need some of the cover of night to be most safe. Also, while any sort of car will do, you may not want to choose the most expensive or cherished vehicle. You can take your slick new black Mercedes for the drive if you'd like, but don't expect it to come out in a pristine state. Make sure your vehicle is completely fueled before beginning the drive.

The first task to accomplish is to locate the road. It doesn't have a name, it's not on the map, and technically, it doesn't even exist. It will only show up if you're looking for it at the right time, and you will only spot it if you know what to look for. Finally, you must be alone during the journey. You didn't think you'd be able to go with a group, did you?

It must be night when you begin. Choose the time of the night where you believe the roads are the least populated. Drive to any area that is just a stretch of road surrounded by woods. Here's where you want to start paying close attention. If you're looking for the road, it will turn up eventually, but you need to search for the road's hint in order to pull down the right one. Once you're close, you will see or feel its signs but what the signs will be will depend on what it is you desire. For example, if you're in search of wealth, you may spot shimmers on the empty branches of trees as if they resembled the shine of gold or diamonds. If you seek love, you may begin to see rose petals slowly dance in the light breeze, blowing in the road's direction. If you seek revenge, you might sense an ever growing feeling of heat or anger in your body as you approach. Just know what it is you really want, and you'll have no problem finding the turn.

Once you're sure you've found the revealed road, take a deep breath, and turn down onto it.

At this point, you have officially started down the nameless road which brings you through 11 miles, leading to whatever it is you seek. Each mile will test your desire, and will expose if you really do want what you're searching for. Before you go any further, stop the car and be wary of a few advisements:

Do not turn on a radio during the drive.

Do not use a phone during the drive (reception would be cut off anyway).

Do not open the windows during the drive. Make sure they are closed before you continue. If you are riding a vehicle without windows or a top, then prepare for the worst, as the odds are heavily against you.

Do not attempt to leave your vehicle at ANY time.

You'll never want to exceed 30 miles per hour, unless you're desperate to make it through a section of the road.

And most importantly, as with any drive, buckle up.

Feel free to prepare and make sure you're ready. Once the road has been entered, time has stopped so you don't need to worry about losing the night. Though you may not notice, you're not actually in your own world anymore. Take one last moment to realize that once the first mile is over there is no turning back. If you ponder turning back at all, know that you shouldn't even be on the journey in the first place. Once all is done, continue on the road.

On the first mile, you won't see much change. The road passes through mostly woods with a few miles being an exception. The air will turn a bit colder, in which you should turn on your heating system if the vehicle has one. You won't want to take your eyes off the road later. Take some time to calm any uneasiness by admiring some of the night sky. You'll see it completely lined with stars, more than what you would ever believe possible. If the weather was cloudy beforehand, you'll also notice that the sky is now clear.

On the second mile, the air will become even colder. This is primarily the reason why traveling in an open vehicle is very difficult. With each mile, the air will drop in temperature even if the season should be warm. If the air is too cold to bear, even with the heat on, your only option is to speed up. With each mile the road also becomes more complex, taking more turns and showing an increasing amount of road hazards. Be sure to always keep focused on the road in front of you in order to avoid as many bumps or obstacles as possible. Hitting a few rocks and potholes won't hamper your progress too much, but you'll want to keep in the best condition for as long as possible. If you're vehicle is forced to a stop because of damage, then there's nothing left you can do but eventually freeze to death.

On the third mile, you may begin to spot silhouettes of human figures in the linings of trees. Pay no attention to them, even if they seem to get closer. It will be hard to resist peeking at their unnerving, distant appearance but know that they will reveal themselves later. At this mile, the road will become dirt if you weren't driving on it in the beginning. Keep to the center of the path as it will become narrow and wide at random intervals. On a quick side note, should you ever attempt to turn around (despite the previous warnings) you'll be left on a path which never ends. You would simply run out of fuel eventually, and be left to freeze in the cold conditions.

On the fourth mile, you will not only see more of the figures but you will begin to in a sense hear them. In the back of your mind, a very faint unintelligible whisper will echo. These will come and go, but you can't stop them. If they become bothersome or distracting, try and tune them out by thinking of what it is you desire. Attempting to listen and determine what the voices are saying will only attract them to you, and you want to be as far away from them as you can. They'll be closer later, so there's no use bringing them near you this early.

On the fifth mile, you will come to a clearing. The lining of trees to your left will disappear to reveal a lake with no end with a beaming, great moon over the water. The illumination from the moon will be so spectacular that the vehicle's headlights will no longer be required. Restrain yourself from gazing at it. If you look at its light for even more than a few seconds the road in front of you will end, throwing your vehicle into the water in which you will freeze in mere minutes. The voices will be gone for this mile, but don't rejoice yet. They'll be back.

On the sixth mile, take into account that you are more than halfway done. Despite the progress, you may lose hope here. The stars will have disappeared at this point, leaving the sky an empty, black abyss. The clearing will have ended, leading you back into the woods. The only light you will have will be provided by your vehicles headlights, but they will flicker from time to time even if you're sure they're in perfect working order.

If you have a radio in the vehicle, it will turn on here automatically. If you didn't turn it off beforehand, it will produce an overwhelming screech that will send you off the path. A calm voice will then begin to speak about your greatest fears, what it is you are horrorified of in your life. It will speak in a way that will cause you to visualize the words in your mind, so don't listen to it. If you begin to comprehend what it's saying, the horrors will prove too much for you to stay on the road safely. Attempting to turn off the radio will prove no use. Speed up if you need to, just keep your mind off the voice as much as you can. As you approach the end of the mile, the voice will fade out of the speakers, leaving your ears at peace (for now).

On the seventh mile, the voices from the figures will return. It won't sound like a whisper this time, but more like distant screams, growing closer with each second. At some point on this mile, you'll hear one of them in your ear, as if one of them were right behind you. This is because one of the figures have found their way into your vehicle. Do not turn around. Their faces will shock you to a paralysis, leading you off the road. If you don't draw attention to it, it will become uninterested, and hopefully leave. These beings are said to be ones who have travelled down this road before, but were not successful. They live the remainder of their existence suffering, in the darkness with their only goal being to bring other travelers down with them. It has been said from experience that these beings can't physically harm you, so as long as they don't cause you to wreck, you should be fine.

On the eighth mile, slow down if you're going too fast. The road here takes very sharp turns, which if overshot will throw the vehicle into a pit through the trees. The cold is near fatal here. If you were to have a glass or bottle of liquid in your vehicle, it would be solid in seconds. The heating system will have become completely obsolete. Your headlights will flicker more, sometimes shutting off for a few seconds. You should break if this happens, but do not completely stop. The figures will be following you at this point, and should you stop for too long, they will surround and trap your vehicle. More of their screams can be heard from outside your doors, sometimes even sounding of maniacal laughter. Their hands will claw at your windows, desperate to reach in and feel something living. Do not look at them. They won't block your windshield, and the last thing you want to happen is to crash and be trapped with them. If you don't make it from here, pray that it's the freezing that ends you.

On the ninth mile, your vehicle will stall. The headlights will shut off, as will all other systems inside. There's nothing you can do to prevent this. What you will need to do is close your eyes and immediately attempt to restart the vehicle. Keep your eyes closed, as the figures would have surely surrounded you at this point. The starting of the vehicle will frighten them, and they will all back away temporarily. This will give you a chance to start moving forward again. If you begin to hear the windows crack from their struggle, don't lose focus. The beings can alter the vehicle but remember that they still do not have the strength to physically affect you. You will hear nothing but their voices rampage in your mind, as there could be anywhere between a dozen or a hundred after you now. Once you start the vehicle, floor it. Floor it so long as you can stay on the path. When the mile's done, the beings will retreat.

On the tenth mile, the voices of the beings will stop. If you were to look in your rear-view mirror (do not actually do this), you will see them following you but not as if they were chasing. They're watching you, as if they were seeing you off. As you go down the tenth mile, the road will be smoother, as if you were back on the first mile. The figures will be lining the sides of the path ahead of you. They won't be after you, but they will watch you as you pass. Some have theorized that the beings are impressed here, that you have come a long way on the journey to what you desire. This is false. They are not impressed, but they are happy. They are happy you are about to approach the next mile. They are happy because you are most likely going to your death.

On the eleventh and final mile, everything in your vehicle will lose power, as it did on the ninth mile. The vehicle would normally be immobile, but you will still be moving. An unknown force will be pulling you forward. In the darkness, you will see a glowing red light up ahead, as if it were a light at the end of a tunnel.

Close your eyes, and cover them. Do whatever it takes to make sure you do not see what you are about to go through. Covering your ears would also be helpful, but keeping your eyes covered should be a higher priority.

The red light is another clearing, but there's no moon or lake this time. Once it's entered, unrelenting and inconceivable noises will sound from all directions. No amount of bravery and conditioning will spare you from these sounds. The cold will turn to a merciless heat, burning all parts of the vehicle. You will feel the illusion of the flesh being burned off your bones, that every part of you is being destroyed as you travel through screams and audible suffering. As long as you keep your eyes closed, and resist the urge to see where you are, you will survive through the suffering. This will last a total of 31 seconds but many fail to keep their vision closed during that time and are left to the worst fate of the road. Where is this mile located? Those who have survived do not know. Some have named it "the transmission from hell" but whether it's part of hell is debatable.

After the final mile, power will return. Stop the vehicle. Take a moment to possibly regain some of your sanity. Let the screaming in your ears begin to fade and know that you have nearly completed your journey with the hardest task overcome.

Breathe, and begin to drive forward once again.

After only a kilometer, your vehicle will arrive at a dead end. Stop here and don't attempt to move again. Nothing will happen right this second but do not be disappointed. Relax and close your eyes. Imagine in your mind what it is you've desired the entire time. It will most likely still be the same as when you entered, but with some this desire may actually change through making this journey. Think about what it was that you went through such terrifying and difficult means to acquire and imagine possessing it in your hands.

Once you have completely visualized this, slowly open your eyes.

You will then find yourself at the beginning of the unnamed road, where you first began. This may confuse you, but know that you are finished. Your task is done.

Your mind will then turn to your reward. If what you desired was material, check in the back seat or in the trunk if the object is larger. If the object was small enough it might already be in your pocket. If what you desired was nonmaterial, then do not be disappointed if the change is not immediate. Turn back to where you came from, and you will find in your life that what you wanted is there. You may have found the love of your dreams. You may have gained unnatural, unimaginable power. You may have put your most hated enemy to the most satisfying revenge possible. You will have no doubt gained what you deserved.

So now that the task is done, what's the catch? Is your vehicle cursed? Is there something you're about to lose? Is your death imminent? The answer to all is no, of course. You've done the challenge. You've proved worthy of what you desire. As stated before, the sounds of the eleventh mile will continue to exist in your mind, potentially causing you some vivid and unusual nightmares but these should prove as nothing compared to what you've gained.

Now, one last question: Is there something else you desire? Are you not yet satisfied? After all, you're left right back where you started. The road's right in front of you, so are you up for another drive?

If so, buckle up, and just move forward.''

I'd like to try this. It seems pretty doable, and all of the challenges can be mitigated by planning ahead (dress in layers. Keep the warmth in, and keep it out.). The only thing that worries me is the last mile. I don't care if I'm in hell, 10th floor outer world, train station purgatory, or anywhere else -- driving with my eyes closed for 31 seconds seems like a bad idea.

Travel to Another World using the Closet - Japanese in origin. Narnia, here I come! 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]4 years ago
Travel to another world using a closet [RECIPE]

All credit for this ritual goes to Saya Yomino, a Japanese woman fluent in English who runs the blog Saya in Underworld. She's responsible for bringing many Japanese rituals and urban legends into the West. "Hide-and-seek alone" and "Travel to another dimension using an elevator" are just a couple. By using this ritual, you can apparently travel to another dimension like the elevator ritual. However, the details are quite vague on what this other world is like.

Materials needed:

    A piece of paper with your name written on it. Saya says in the ritual's original Japanese, it is written you must use a fudepen, or a brush pen. The paper's size must also be small enough to fit in the cups.

    Two cups: One filled with water to the 7th of its capacity, and the other empty. The cups have to be ones you use in your everyday life, and preferably glass.

    A cardboard box large enough for one person to sit in and still have a bit of extra space. (If you're a tall guy like me, this may be a bit problematic!)

Performing the ritual: After you've finished all the preparations, get inside the closet and sit inside the cardboard box. Make sure the closet doors are shut tight so no light can penetrate inside. While inside the box, complete the following steps:

    Put the paper with your name on it into the water-filled cup.

    Close your eyes. Count up to the number that is the square of your age, in time with your heartbeat (e.g. If you're twelve count 144, if twenty-two count 484 and so on)

    When finished counting, open your eyes, and transfer the water and the soaked paper to the other cup.

Now step out of the closet - and you will know. Also take caution to not damage the cups in any way.

... That is where the details of the ritual given by Saya ends. There's no description of the other dimension... Just the fact "you will know" you're there. There is also no details on how to return to the "real world." Judging by the warning to not damage the cups, I'd assume that you have to get in the closet, count again (maybe in reverse), and transfer the paper and water to the original cup. So, if you're going to perform this ritual, I'd do it with extreme caution.

So it's a less elaborate version of this ritual, essentially you just need the two cups. I actually like the way this extended version of the ritual is set up though. I feel it's beneficial for newer experimenters to go through with the full ritual the way it's laid out by OP.

Anyways, the basis of the version I use requires just two cups, two pieces of paper, and water. You reflect on your experience as it is now and think of one word that charachterizes it. Then you contemplate the way you want things to be and condense down that state into another word.

Place each word on a piece of paper and attach one to each cup. Fill the cup with water that represents things as they are now. Now, while imagining things changing from the way they are to the way you want them to be, pour the water from the first cup into the second. Drink the water from this second cup, remove the notes, put the cups away and relax into the relief that things are now, literally, going your way.

To address the big question I've seen, "How do you get back? " I'll answer that. Essentially you aren't going to a new dimension. If you picture everything you are currently experiencing as a list, everything that you label that currently is a part of your present moment is on this list. For the sake of this explanation imagine that every item in this list is a "dimension" of your experience. So the "needing to get back" is actually a logical error. You don't actually leave and go somewhere else, you're actually "editing" your list of dimensions the make up your experience to align it more with what you want.

So that's more of dimension jumping than the ritual, I'd say. Actually it sounds exactly like dimension jumping. You say it worked, though? You had a successful jump? That's cool. I follow the r/dimensionaljumping subreddit but have never attempted.

I have a question about your personal opinion of it. Do you think a lot of it is mental and the shift is mostly in your consciousness, kind of like a placebo effect, or do you think that it genuinely works?

That depends on the framework you use to perceive things. A concept I have near the center of my own framework is the idea that we can never know a truly objective universe. The closest we get is the subjective perspective we create in our minds.

You never truly see the "outside world" because whatever you believe you are seeing is your minds construction of that idea, not the idea itself. Your consciousness when viewed like this can be described as a sort of filter for what you are aware of.

So to answer your question, both. I think it's similar to editing your filter. Because you only ever experience what's in your mind edits to the filter of what your mind is aware of is as real as it gets.

Assuming this does work for you, you would simply realign yourself with your original vibrations. Everything works through intent. It's not the ritual itself that works, it's just a method to let you convince your own consciousness to shift.

Astral Projection - out of body experience. Link is offsite. 1 player. 1 2 3 4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
irst, what is astral projection? Astral projection is simply the transferring of the consciousness from the physical body to the astral body. We have several 'vehicles' for our consciousness, and the astral body is one of them.

Now, I will outline the progress of how I learned to astral project:
Desire:

First is the desire. I have a friend who experiences the beginning states of astral projection, but has no interest in pursuing it, therefore never goes anywhere. "Why?" she asks. Well, if you don't build the interest and suitable desire, you're more than likely to go nowhere, and that is probably as it should be. We are all on individual paths, and no one can judge the course of another.
Fear:

"Fear is the great barrier to human growth." Robert Monroe, Ultimate Journey. This is why once you've built the desire, relaxed and can concentrate, you need to lose the fear. One of the biggest obstacles is the initial fear of the vibrational stage. There is also the fear that you'll die; fear that you won't come back; fear that your body will be possessed. I have never known of anyone to suffer any of these ailments. In fact, after visiting a particularly gorgeous place, I'll do everything in my power to NOT come back! But to no avail! No matter what you do, you WILL come back (unless of course you have a heart attack in the middle of your sleep). Fear is a reoccurring theme (and/or lesson) that people have to overcome in order to advance in astral projection. You're not alone; everyone, at some time or another, will have to surpass one of the biggest obstacles. This theme, however, applies to all areas of our life, so when you can overcome this one, your whole life will be enriched. I've read a vast array of books, talked with many people on this subject, and I have drawn one conclusion, and that is to face it. You can read until you're blue in the face on how to deal with fear, how to control your emotions, that there's nothing to fear but fear itself, but until you face it head on and overcome it, these will be just words. And even when you face it and think you have learned the lesson, it will take on another shape and another form and reoccur until the lesson is thoroughly worked out. Then you will see it disappear from your life because it is no longer needed. I met my guide once in the astral and he told me that there were seven cycles of life and fear is one of them. We will cycle through these lessons until each one is resolved. What happens in our life is neutral, and it's up to us to view it as positive, negative, spiritual, or mundane.
Concentration:

One of my personal big obstacles! I can relax just fine, but when I try and quiet my mind and focus on one thing, a thought slips in and I'm off on a fantasy. My most successful attempts are when I can clear the mind and use several techniques; either focusing on my third eye, using a particular visualization tool or affirmation. Practice concentration, via meditation, looking at candles, or whatever your preference is. Robert Peterson in "Out of Body Experiences" states that, "The single most important factor in leaving the body is that you focus your consciousness down to a single, focused, barely noticeable thread." Do you ever stop and listen for that "high pitched noise" in your head? Sometimes, if it's really quiet, I can stop and listen for it. Robert Peterson states that if you can hold your concentration on this very noise for three minutes that the vibrations will rush in.
Relaxation:

Countless people have repeatedly stressed this and that's because it's true. If you're upset over a job, spouse, health, finances, or whatever, more than likely this will be what is consuming you, not astral projection. Clear your load if you want to pursue astral projection. We cannot escape work, loved ones, bills or traffic, but we can do a little to minimize the "noise" in our life and this may also include having to make long term decisions. Is your career keeping you from pursuing the higher things? Are you accumulating too much physical goodies via credit which perpetuates the stressful job in order to pay for them and thus keeps you up at night? Is your spouse in tune with you and your goals, or creating disharmony? If we want to project, we eventually have to lead a lifestyle that is conducive to it. We cannot live like monks in a quiet monastery, but we do have choices and we can chose compatible mates, get less stressful jobs, work towards simple lifestyles that allow for freedom and more quiet time.

Here are some things that I have personally implemented myself: knowing when is "enough" in my career. I'm a SQL Server Database Administrator, and people ask me why I don't go into development, well, because it's too stressful and time consuming and not worth the $5-$10 more an hour. I changed my work hours from 7:00-3:00 so I could avoid longer time in traffic (it's rotten here in Seattle). I try and pay my bills off before accumulating more stuff to keep anxiety down. I keep my associations to meaningful ones (quality vs. quantity type friends) which means only a couple. I develop patience and tolerance towards my loved ones which keeps me from getting unduly upset. I meditate regularly and keep extraneous noises like TV and radio to a minimum. These are just a few examples. It won't happen overnight, but if you work on your goals, you'll get there.

Focus 10: (aka the hypnagogic state-- see Glossary for term definition).
People say, "I'm relaxed and all, but I still can't leave". It is more than just relaxation. The body must be **asleep** yet the mind awake. I try and catch myself as I'm coming out of sleep in the morning which is an acquired skill, but doable (I can't do this at night because I'm too tired)-- See "My Favorite Technique" under the Weekly Commentary link. You shouldn't be able to feel your body (sort of like going numb). Your sense of hearing and touch will vanish and you will start to see images float across your mind. Don't let yourself slip into a dream, but instead gently hold your concentration and keep deepening the sleep state. If you do this coming out of morning sleep, catch yourself before you fully wake up and gently focus on your third eye. Don't strain, otherwise you wake up. The vibrating should follow.
Separation:

Ok, now the interesting stuff! There is no way to fully prepare a person for astral projection. Practice, desire and trial and error are the best teachers. However, you can at least expect some or all of the following things. For me, one of the first experiences I felt prior to separation was the buzzing. My whole body vibrated!

The first time is always shocking and you'll usually throw yourself out of the state before anything happens, but if you can, just let the vibrations continue. You're so close! I now know that when these vibrations start, I'm well on my way to separation. Usually, when the vibrating starts, I can raise my astral hands, legs and so forth. The last for me to detach is usually my head. I think our heads contain the strongest hold to our physical body. There were many times where my whole body was significantly raised, but my head would just stick. I'm not alone. Albert Taylor wrote in Soul Traveler, "I woke up in the paralysis state and, without my producing, the lower half of my body began to float. Like the hinged lid of a music box, my astral body moved up and my head rotated backward! The soles of my astral feet were pointing straight at the ceiling. I was upside down and facing backward, but my astral head was still connected to my physical head. I hung there upside down staring at the headboard of our bed. I couldn't seem to break free, so I gave up and reconnected."

After thinking about this awhile (I also posted this to my Science Results page), I think this is because most of our primary chakras are in the head region and chakras are energy (and where there is energy, there is magnetism). When I project, the first thing to raise are my hands, and hands don't have a primary chakra. So it's the utter stilling of the head area chakras (thus reducing the magnetic pull) that allows separation.

Ok, so your body is vibrating and you can lift your limbs; now you should start hearing popping, cracking, hissing noises. It can be one or many of these symptoms. I have also heard screams (ugh) and nasty noises, but I now just ignore them. Who knows what kind of parasites hang around our astral body, but I can tell you, they are harmless. So now that you've gotten this far, get out! I do this several ways.

    Rollout (this is also the technique Robert Monroe used). I rollout by simply acting like I'm falling out of bed, as in rolling out of my body, onto the floor.
    Arch my back and buck myself out. Sometimes if my head gets stuck I just "throw" myself out. This takes sheer will power.
    Grab something solid and pull! It doesn't matter how far away the solid object is, I think you're basically using the solid object as a mental crutch to get out.
    Rise and move. I surprised myself lately by just doing this passive technique. I "willed" myself to rise above my body and move onto the floor, which I did. I'm sure with time, it gets easier and easier, no matter which technique you use. I remember how I struggled over and over to get out of my body, but now, once the vibrating starts, I always say, "gosh, it's so easy, what was I fussing over?" I also have a theory where I think we have this substance that connects us to our physical body, and that it is magnetic in nature. I think over time as we continually leave our body, this elasticity gets stretched and loosens its tight grip. Some people are born with loose holds on their physical body and can pop out with little to no effort. My girlfriend's brother leaves his body all the time during his afternoon nap but has no idea why and doesn't really care.

Move away from body: When you are close to your physical body, you are probably still in your etheric body. The etheric body is electromagnetic in nature, and you will experience some of the following until you get away from the magnetic range (also read the article under Weekly Commentary called "Our Five Bodies".

    You get pulled back. The body has a natural magnetic pull to your etheric, and until you get far enough away and move into your astral, you will be repeatedly pulled back into it. This feels like being drunk because the pull from your physical pulls you to and fro, trying to attach you back to your physical. This is rather a comical state, but can be annoying if you are simply trying to look around while close to your body.
    Astral blindness is also another common side effect. If I'm too close to my body (within about 10 feet), I am equivalent to being blind. I usually use my hands to feel around, or since I know the layout of my room, I just move away from my body. Besides, in the astral, it's not like you have to be careful of bumping into things and hurting yourself. I do know that the better I get, the more I can simply "will" myself to see, but this is still a lot easier if I just get away from the physical body. When I move far enough away, my astral vision comes into focus, the wobbling stops and I'm totally free.
    There are strong auditory distractions, and as I mentioned before, if I'm close to my body, I can hear radio waves (in the form of talking, music, etc.) I also noticed (after reading over my journal) that there is this really annoying buzzing in the equivalent of my astral ears that sounds like a hornet is in my ear! This only happens which I'm close to my body, but on more than one occasion, I have leapt back to my body out of freight because I thought some bug was in my ear! And I do hate bugs!
    Spouses: If your spouse loves attention in the physical, he or she will be even more eager in the astral. Tip: just ignore them and move away. You can try and talk to them, but unless they are developed, they will hold no conscious memory of you.

As you can see, once you get the hang of things, it's better to just get out of the room and start your journey.

Take off: Once you are away from your body, you will slowly progress from the old physical habit of leaving out your front door to just zooming through the roof (and when you're really experienced, you will just think yourself to your destinations). You will eventually overcome your fear of heights (I've done work in the astral where I've helped my closest friend into the outer atmosphere to help her with her fear of heights). It's all very heady because you're not used to the speed, the height, the colors, and the sounds. So what do you do? I learned that all I had to do is ask and my consciousness would do the rest. One of my first trips was to the moon, then I asked to see a deceased relative, I also asked to see a place of great beauty and I'm still recuperating from that wonderful experience!

If you want the specifics for my particular technique, I wrote an article under the "Weekly Commentary" link that is called "My Favorite Technique".

Good luck and have fun.

Calling the Void [RECIPE](self.threekings)
submitted 6 years ago by cruleings to /r/threekings

Are you depressed or suicidal? Do you feel like you'll never live up to your potential? Have you ever even had any potential at all? Does the sadness feel so heavy inside that you fear it will soon smother your pulse?

Even better, maybe you're just angry? Do you have an intense amount of rage thrashing in your gut, so lethal that unleashing it would cause destruction to all that dared to get too close? Would it destroy you as well?

One or more of these feelings are necessary for this ritual, but only one is absolutely vital: The dire need of relief.

Let's face it, if you're so desperate as to search for ritual to cure your agony you've found the right one. What I'm going to teach you to summon only settles only for the most damaged, tortured spirits and will only take them for a price. You didn't think it was just going to reward you for being damaged did you? If so, you should go back to your therapist.

Calling the Void.

Tools Needed:

-One avian feather

-One piece of parchment

-One ruler

-One book of matches

-One teaspoon of the summoners blood (tears may suffice but only if shed in true agony)

-One stem of ordinary blackboard chalk

-One cement surface

-One very small mirror

-One sober mind

-One empty, dark, silent room (preferably underground: basements are perfect)

WARNING: There are no safety procedures during this ritual. If you are worthy of this ritual you shouldn't care if you happen to "go missing". There are no electronic devices (or ways to contact any form of humanity or what is known as the "incarnate world") allowed in the room you are performing in once the ritual starts. Once the ritual is entered there is no turning back. This is the ultimate commitment. Failure to call the void does not mean the ritual is over. Just because you don't receive a response doesn't mean it's not listening.

Step one: At dusk seek out a place that has a cement surface. Drive ways are great, so are parking lots. Just about anywhere that will be able to be marked with chalk will do. Once you find your spot break out your ruler and chalk and draw three horizontal lines. The first should be seven inches long exactly, the second should be five inches long and the third should be exactly three inches long. Mirror these lines on the opposite side as well. These are your vibrations.

Step two: Once you've acquired your blood or tears dip your feather (which I hope to god you've disinfected) into the liquid and write the first word that comes to mind onto the parchment. Please refrain from writing your name, as it already knows who you are by your blood. This is your introduction. (Warning: Once this step is completed the ritual cannot be ended.)

Step three: Burn the parchment and place it in the very center of your vibrations, between the two three inch marks. Wait until the parchment has turned to ash and then stomp it out into the ground. Gather a bit of the ash on your finger tips and smudge one spot on each of the backs of your hands and a spot in the middle of your forehead. You have just sealed your call.

Step four: Walk to your dark, quiet room. (Note: you must only WALK to the room. Any other transportation is forbidden and will have serious consequences.) Pay no attention to those who try to get your attention as you walk. There will be people who will try to stop you, you must ignore them fully and keep your eyes forward. As you walk, let your sadness/anger consume you. Embrace it. Let it eat you alive, feel it as you have never felt before. This entices it and will beckon it to follow you.

Step five: Leave all of your possessions at the door and enter your dark, quiet room. Close and lock the door behind you. You should have a small mirror, no bigger than a compact, placed in the middle of the room. You must be certain you are in absolute darkness. Sit in the middle of the room with your mirror, reflective side down, in front of you. Close your eyes. Breath inward deeply to the count of three heartbeats, hold your breath for five and breath out for seven. Do this three times. Clear you mind of all thought.

Step six: Feel all of your pain at once. Let is smash you like an avalanche. Cry and moan as hard as you possibly can and then, once you are certain you've got all of your suffering exposed, let out the most agonizing, blood curdling scream that you can muster into your palms.

Step seven (Staring Into the Abyss): If you are successful you will feel a presence behind you. You will feel dizzy and light headed. Your entire body will ache. If you've ever been high on an opiate or very drunk, you might recognize this feeling. The void preys on those who are at their most vulnerable so it is absolutely vital that you are sober and only vulnerable with pure agony. It doesn't react kindly to cheaters. Now, slowly let yourself fall back. Let your limbs go limp, and slowly, quietly fall and submit yourself to the void. As you fall you will notice that underneath your body you will feel wet. Do not panic. If you are not successful, put yourself through mental torture and anguish until you are. This could take a while.

Step eight: You will now start to feel vibrations flowing through your insides. To make sure that these vibrations are true and not your mind playing tricks on you, feel around for your compact mirror and hold it up to your eye. If your pupils appear to be dilated and vibrating, you are successful. Put the mirror down, close your eyes, let your body go lax and wait for the void to come through you.

Step nine (The Abyss Stares Back): You will hear a voice speaking beside your conscience. Congratulations, you have received a response. Answer it's questions in full honesty no matter how personal or hard to answer they may be. Do not speak unless spoken to. Then, when asked, tell it what you have to offer: all of the pain you have inside. Then tell it what you have to trade.

Step ten: Relief of certain kinds of anguish require certain prices. For example: what would you trade to gain a purpose in life or to know your true worth? For this, you will have to sacrifice your sense of pride.

Do you wish to get even with someone who hurt you? You can make them feel all of your pain for the rest of their life, for the price of your ability to feel love.

Are you so sick of humanity that you wish to unleash pure havoc on the world via natural disaster? You can make it happen if you trade in your ability to see and speak.

Have you lost the trust of a loved one? How about a few? You can gain back a person's trust in exchange for all of your memories you have with that person.

Do you wish to bring a person back from the dead? Would you sacrifice your life for theirs? Well if you truly want this, you will have to follow through with your answer.

Please remember: all transactions are final.

Step eleven: After your transaction is made, if you survive, you will wake up from a deep sleep in a hospital. Medical staff will inform you that you have attempted suicide, and from the looks of it you quite possibly have, they will let you out after a few hours of questions. You will never be informed on how you tried to end your life, no matter how many times you ask, you will always be ignored.

Step twelve: Enjoy your new life. Relish in your freshly bought reality, but remember, the void will always be inside you. It will be watching and lingering within you for the rest of your life. If it has a message for you, you will always be forced to listen. It owns a piece of you now, and you are forever in debt.

I hope that you will find whatever you wish to trade worth your satisfaction.

[Recipe] Sympathy From The Devil

There are things that wander through the darkness; gods, demons, the Unnamed. In winter, it is possible to earn the gratitude of these entities with a simple ritual.

Ingredients

Hand-sawn wood w/ bark

Axe or Hammer and Wedge

1 bread crust

1 apple

A knife

When fresh snow has fallen, wait until dark and and saw a log into two or more pieces (small enough to fit in a wood-burning stove or fireplace) and carry these to an open place where you can feel the wind. Listen for the wind in the trees or tall grass; if it sounds as if someone is pacing just out of sight, proceed to chop your logs into smaller pieces as you usually would. DO NOT address the darkness at this point.

When you have split the logs sufficiently, select one piece of clean firewood and place it on top of your Judas Log* or the ground and use large fragments of bark to construct a rudimentary house over the firewood; these your gifts of warmth and shelter to the wanderers. Once you are convinced your structure will withstand a slight breeze, place the crust of bread and the first slice of your apple under the roof on either side of the firewood, and whisper your request to the darkness without taking your eyes off the shelter. This request should be something you need, since your offering is of necessities (warmth, shelter, and a meal) but not something you want; asking for something you want grants the wanderer who comes across your offering the right to demand from you what they desire as well, and you cannot refuse this request once your request has been granted.

Finally, carry away your firewood and tools, turning your back on your offering, and do not return to that spot until the morning; if at all possible, do not look at that spot between midnight and 3am, or else you may be compelled to spend the remainder of the night in the cold with the wanderer, sharing stories. Tales told by these wanderers are best left unheard.

After the sun has risen the next day, if the structure remains intact, your offering has been accepted, and you should collect the firewood and burn it in your own hearth to receive the wanderer's gift. If, however, the pieces of your structure have been scattered (not merely knocked over by the wind, but strewn about violently, and your food offering trod into the snow) then your offering has been rejected; under no circumstances should the firewood be burnt; it is best to chop your offering into smaller pieces and bury it in earth mixed with salt.

*The Judas Log is the piece of wood you put under the log you are chopping, so you don't waste energy hammering a log into the earth.

This sounds interesting. However, I have a question regarding the tales of the wanderers. Why are the stories best left unheard? In fact, I kind of like the idea of talking with one. Would I be in danger?

Hypothermia, for sure. There's also no way to know for sure which wanderer you're going to encounter, so even if you're bundled up and you have a fire pit set up with plenty of fuel, you should take the usual precautions.

As for the stories themselves; those vary from wanderer to wanderer, of course, but you may learn things that will make you want to lock yourself in your room for the rest of your life.

Does this only work in the snow? Also, what would you say is the difference between a "want" and a "need"? A "want" being money and a 'need' being say, health?

[Recipe] гном гном прийти

Hi all, I've been reading this sub for about three days now, and I think that you would like to know about a certain ritual from my childhood.

I was in elementary school when I had a friend whose mom was Russian. Sometime around when I was about 10 years old, he taught me this ritual. It's called гном гном прийти (transliterated 'gnom gnom priyti', pronounced like this. It means basically 'gnome gnome come').

Items you need:

    One piece of chocolate

    One piece of paper, scissors and some tape

    A blanket large enough to cover all the participants

The basic rules:

    There can be no adults present when this ritual is being performed. And when I mean present, I mean there can be adults in the house, but not in the same room.

    You have to have an odd number of people performing this ritual. Also, everyone in the room must be a part of the ritual, so no spectators in the room, the gnome is very shy. ;)

What you need to do:

So, first make a cone from the paper. Then go to the room where you intend to hold the ritual. Dim the lights and cover all the windows. You don't need pitch black darkness for this to work, just make the room as dark as you can. Place the piece of chocolate to the floor and cover it with the paper cone you've made earlier. Then you should sit around the cone in a circle. Cover yourselves with the blanket and grab each others hands. Close your eyes and chant three times: "гном гном прийти", and sit quietly for about one minute. Then, throw the blanket away and SMACK the cone away with force. You shouldn't just pick it up, you need to hit it as hard as you can as far away as possible, the gnome doesn't want to be seen after all. Then you can hit the lights and go examine the chocolate. It should have small teeth marks. You've just given a treat to a gnome living near you.

Nothing bad ever happened to me or any of my friends, so I guess that this is a very low risk ritual. I performed this ritual many times with different friends and usually got the teeth marks on the chocolate. My friend said, that he was told that children who break these rules can make the gnome angry, and it can - for example - bite one of your toes when you sleep.

Oh my god, I used to do a similar gnome ritual! and I am from the Russian background. nice to see someone else did creepy childhood things! ours was a bit different, we used to draw a circle with a pen and place the candy or cookie in the middle to find the marks.

We basically had two versions, first one was to scare the little ones. You basically draw a circle, put a treat in the middle and just do the chant, turn away and then after the 'ritual' was done, you'd see a break in your circle. This version could be done in broad daylight, because it's basically like looking for a break in the ink of your hand drawn circle. The second version was a bit more exciting. From what i can recall the chant was either the same, or 'gnom gnom prihodi'. Which is, like an invitation for him to come. Because gnomes are small, it was done in a dark room under a table, and we drew a circle, placed the treat inside the circle, and then we'd either go out of the room or turn away for a few moments. When you would turn back you'd notice a break in a circle as well as the treat either bitten or wet as if it fell out of a mouth..

Cool! I'm not entirely sure that the chant I wrote is correct because the only things I can say in Russian are руки вверх and сто грамм водка, so your 'gnom gnom prikhodi' might also be the one we were chanting. And that was about 10 - 15 years ago, too.

In which part of Russia are you/your family from? I would like to know if this ritual is from a certain region or is it known all over Russia.

AHAHAH the vodka one just killed me! I'm not really from Russia, but from Uzbekistan which was a part of the former Soviet. My older cousins all knew little things like this that they taught me, because they were all born during the communist regime. There are very strange rituals my mom told me about that originate from Russia's villages. Because of the whole communist regime, the deep parts of Russia did some weird things... especially weird religious things.

I've never tried it in English, or even in Finnish, which is my mother tongue, so I guess that one has to try if it works or not. If I were to be thinking this logically, I presume it makes sense that it would work in any languages, since the gnomes would probably speak the major language in a country they live in.

Four Finger Lift - another group ritual to lift someone using only fingertips. 5 people.

[RECIPE] 4 Finger Lift

Hello, I just found a recipe to a ritual (I think? Because I don't know if there's a scientific explanation for this or it's rlly the real deal) and decided to share it. I'm not sure if this is already posted somewhere so I apologize in advance if there's already a post about this that I am not aware of. Anyway here we go.

You will need the following:

    A chair

    5 People

The ritual:

    Have one person sit on the chair. The person must be calm.

    The four other people will have to position their hands in a kancho hand gesture (search up kancho and look how they position their hands) or like a hand gun gesture but with both hands clasped together. I'm not sure how to explain it.

    One person will put it on the person on the chair's right armpit (Don't laugh it might ruin it!) Another person on the left armpit. Another person on the part where the back of the knees are and another on the other side. Basically, one person limb.

    Try to lift the person using that position. Did it work? Probably no.

    The 4 people hover their hands over the person on the chair's head. 5a) All right hands must be hovered first. Like stacking your hands without touching each other above the head of the person on the chair. Make sure you hover hands one by one! 5b) After having all right hands hover over the head, now have your left hands hover. You still do it one by one and the same order as the right hands. And the person on the chair musn't look up.

    After stacking the non touching hovering hands, you must remove one by one. The hand on the top is put down first and then the hand under it.

    Now, put your hands back in the kancho hand position/gun hands.

    Make sure you're in the same body part as last time. For example: on the first attempt your on the right armpit, on the second attempt you must still be on the right armpit. Now try to lift. Did it work? It should.

I'm not sure if there's a con iin this ritual but as far as I know there is none. We've tried it using people of approximately the same weight and at first attempt it was rlly impossible but the second attempt lifting was like nothing. We also tried using the skinniest 4 to lift the heaviest. We only managed to lift a little bit. We also tried lifting the skinniest person with only one hand (so it's like a 2 hand lift now) and we got to lift her for a few minutes before we all burst into laughter. We also had failed attempts.

A Weird Game I Found in My Backpack - an odd recipe with no clear objective, although it might help you get rid of vermin you've captured. 1 player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found rules for a weird game in my backpack

This was originally posted on NoSleep, but was removed for not being a story. Everything under this paragraph is that post. I am still trying to figure out what is even happening.

A lot of it is ripped or scribbled on, I'm only typing up what I can gather. The handwriting is almost illegible, and it seems a lot of it is gone. SUPPLIES A red, black, and white candle for every room and hallway in your house. Something with four legs, something with two legs, something with no legs. It must be a living being. A rat, a chicken, and a fish will work. An alarm. Matches. A bottle of saltwater. A room you will stay in. RULES Open every single door in your house. Closet doors and pantry doors, every door. Place a red, black, and white candle in a line in that order in every doorway and the end of every hallway. Do not light them, and turn off every light in your house. Go to your room, and place candles there as well. However, close and LOCK the door to the room you are in, as well as any windows. Take your animals, and place in one of the bathrooms with a toilet in your house. This bathroom should have unlit candles as well. One of these animals will not be there later. Go to sleep that night, between 11:30 and 12:00. Close your eyes at midnight. He is going to come the moment you go to sleep. If you are not asleep by then, very bad things will happen to you. So go to sleep. Your alarm should be set for 3:21 AM. Wake up immediately and check that the door to your room is not open but don't move. If the door to your room, or any door in your room, is open, do not move. Do not look under your bed. Just stay there and close your eyes, and no matter what he does don't open them or talk or anything. If the door is still closed, good. It worked probably. Now take your match or lighter or whatever and WALK slowly to the bathroom where the animals are. One of them should be gone. Now be warned, but do not show fear, every door that was opened before you slept will probably be closed. He is very clever. If any door is still open, or any of the lights are on, calmly get out of the house and don't come back until 6 AM. If the four legged one is gone, go to each room after knocking four times, WALKING, and light the black candle with the match or lighter. If there is a really bad smell in that room, do not look up. Lie face down on he ground and stay there, do not be scared, just don't look up and don't move. No matter what he does do not look up. Just lie there and he will probably leave by daytime. But it might not, it could be longer. After it leaves, make sure you keep the black candle lit, and do not be alarmed if any pets disappear in or around the house. Keep buying animals, rats will do, every week and put them in that room and close that door - do NOT go into that room anymore unless you are putting an animal in there. If the two legged animal is gone, you must go to each closed door, knock twice, and close your eyes. Open the door, keep your eyes closed, and walk to the other end of the room, keeping your eyes closed, and face the opposite wall, KEEPING YOUR EYES CLOSED. You will know if he is there. He will whisper, laugh, whatever, but he will not touch you unless you open your eyes. Just stay there until you know FOR SURE what direction he is in. He might go away, he might not. If he doesn't go for a few hours, spash the bottle of saltwater on him, keeping your eyes closed. He will scream but you must not run. Open your eyes and quickly light the white candle and close your eyes again. He will probably leave. If he does not, ... And that's all I could understand, what happens if he doesn't leave or if the no legged creature is gone, remains a mystery to me right now. I don't know where the other papers are, I searched my bag, but it seems to be gone. It's a joke, I hope. EDIT: I had my laptop in my bag... Inside the laptop was a little piece of paper. It said: Running will make him excited. Do not run. Screaming will make him scared. Do not scream. Fighting will make him mad. Do not fight. Looking will make you do one of these. Do not look. ... WTF is this. Seriously I'm confused. EDIT 2: I just got a voicemail. Unknown caller. It was very muffled but I could vaguely make out the words "four-two-one", and "invite" and "he needs invite". I think I also heard "he help" but I dunno. The voice sounded very deep and metallic and kind of gravely, but a lot was static, and I couldn't understand. I am thoroughly weirded out. And to those who choose to play, good luck, post back when you're done. You'll probably be fine but this is getting weirder... Also I'm not responsible for anything that happens to you, but just in case, heh-heh.

Honestly, this sounds like a joke somebody wrote up. It's got elements of creepypastas, parts of some of the rituals here and other things. It doesn't even list any boons or reasons for doing it nor any ritualized things. I would be very surprised. Someone is pulling a prank on you.

Edit: Assuming the OP didn't write it, it's also very obvious they're reading the OPs comment history.

Probably yeah it is. As I said a lot of it was gone so IDK, maybe there are benefits. I can't find it on Creepypasta but it's like that candle game sort of.

But everything on that post including edits 1 and 2 were on NoSleep before. I haven't edited the post in ThreeKings yet.

New Ritual for you (Channel ∞)

There is a legend circulating around the television industry. It is about Channel ∞. Channel ∞ is hard to get to, and reports vary as to what it actually is. I will tell you what to do to get there and then what to do.

    Acquire a television, preferably analog, and the older the better.

    Acquire a remote control. It does not have to go with the television you are using.

    Turn on the TV, and set it to a channel that is static, or just a plain black screen if you are using a digital TV. Basically any channel you do not receive.

4)Leave the room for about three hours. If you have a significant other in the house, have them with you. It is also best to call over a few friends.

5) During those three hours, you should acquire a few items. I will list them in order from the most important to the least. Note: None of these are mandatory, but they help.

6) You will want:

A item that you hold dear
two handheld mirrors
a firearm or other weapon
a favorite book
a mobile communications device
a key
a sledgehammer or pickax 

7) After roughly three hours have passed, re-enter the room. Have everyone else wait outside the door.

8) Close the door.

9) Stare at the static or blank screen or whatever you set the TV to until you feel disoriented or freaked out.

10) Call the others into the room.

11) Give the item that you hold dear to the person that you care about the most in the room, then send them back out. If you did not grab an item that you hold dear, hug that person and whisper a secret in their ear.

12) Send them back out, and command them to not come back in no matter what until you open the door again. Note: This will be harder for them if there are more of them, but it will be safer for you if there are ore people. Trust me.

13) Hold the mirrors so that one is reflecting the television screen into the other, and the second is reflecting you, so it looks as if the television is behind you. Stay like this until a question appears on the screen. If you did not grab the mirrors, then sit in a chair facing away from the TV until you hear a noise.

14) Grab the remote. There will be a question on the screen. press channel up to answer yes, channel down to answer no. There will be anywhere from three to 26 questions, if reports are to be trusted. The questions will be anywhere from trivial to deep philosophic personal questions. Answer truthfully, or you will not succeed in reaching Channel ∞.

15) After the questions, one of three things will happen.

    Your favorite show of all time will come on, but in the episode, all of the characters will be heart-wrenchingly killed.

    A strange shimmery vortex will surround you, and you will be pulled into an alternate dimension. If you find yourself here, well, that's for a different story. But I can say that here is where you will need the mobile communications device, key, and sledgehammer or pickax. I will tell you what to do, but not here. I'll link it here once I write it.

    You will see a picture of your least favorite person or thing ever. This is where you use the firearm or other weapon. Break the TV screen with the weapon. It will then fix itself.

After this, you will have reached Channel ∞. What you do now is up to you. If you go to the guide function, you will see shows listed such as "The Meaning of Life" or "How to Acquire True Love". Choose one. Note: The more people you have outside the door with determine the revelations that are the shows. The more people, the better chance you have of seeing shows with more life-changing results. Or, if you keep watching the static without going to guide or breaking eye contact with the television, you will see a series of images that will, if deciphered, will reveal the answer to your greatest question. There are, at this point, many options, too many to write here. Just do what you feel like you must, and something will happen. The overwhelming majority of things will be good, but some will be bad. You may leave the room at any point. However, there are two catches. You may never speak of what you learned after accessing Channel ∞, and you may only reach Channel ∞ four times in your life.

I hope you find the experience enlightening.

    Your favorite show of all time will come on, but in the episode, all of the characters will be heart-wrenchingly killed.

What if your favorite show of all time already does that? Does it just skip that thing?

For example, my favorite show of all time is Xena: Warrior Princess. The main two characters are killed off at least once a season. Heart-wrenchingly, most of the time. If I did this ritual, would it pick from the other 2 and omit this option entirely?

Wings of a Celestial Repost [recipe]

Some people wanted it, so here it is. It took about five minutes to find on Google.

DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DEAL WITH THE RESULTS.

Can result in:

Permanent Haunting

Small Scarring of the Body

Large Scarring of the Body

Mental Scarring

Continuous Headaches

Leg Cramps

Heart Attack

Death

Wings of a Celestial is not your typical 'scary party game' the consequences are very big, and very real. The ritual was used by many, in many ways, but, the most known is by wiccans who wished to end their lives inconspicuously.

Now, the ritual is more commonly used to attempt to gain the ever wished for immortality.

Yes, the same ritual that ended the lives of many poor souls, granted immortality to a select few. How, you ask? No, no, no it's not one of those stupid 'you may wish for anything you desire' sort of things. The reason Wings of a Celestial brings and takes life, is simply because of the intention of the person doing the ritual. If you want to die: You die. If you never want to die: You'll never die.

...

•What you will need•

-Sharpie

-A friend

-Chalk

-The ritual-

    Take a sharpie or any type of drawing material and a pair of angel wings with a few stray stars in the middle, the wings can be anywhere on your body that you please. ( If your intention is something other than dying; this is where your scar will be when all is over.)

    Go outside on the night of the fullest moon in the week that you're doing the ritual.

    Stare at a single star, this will be your celestial.

    Have someone draw 17 chalk circles around your body as you continue to look at the star.

    Repeat this "Celestial, I see, I do, I plead, you look into my deepest darkest memories and see what I really truly do intend to do here." You will get a chill, this is okay, you must continue to stare at the star. Do NOT look away.

    Cross your fingers over your heart.

    Walk forward. Smile at your star.

    Go to bed.

Enjoy.

either way, that guy had shut up, and his posts were deleted about 3, 4 days ago. aside from that, there's a bit of grammar here that doesn't make sense.

"Take a sharpie or any type of drawing material and a pair of angel wings with a few stray stars in the middle, the wings can be anywhere on your body that you please."

I get that I'm supposed to draw the wings, but it isn't stated, and might lead to some confusion. all that aside though, I appreciate you going through the trouble of finding this, though, make sure you remember, it never pays to reward people who act like u/givemy100 did.

This is a direct copy and paste of the original (that Google cached), so the grammar errors are all the OP's fault.

Anyways, I think that it means:

Take a sharpie or other writing utensil and draw a pair of angel wings with a few stars between them. You can draw this wherever you want.

The String Game - form a bond between you and four of your friends that will last forever. 5 players.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[RECIPE] The String Game

I bring you what I like to call The String Game, since it doesn't really have an official name. The String Game consists of a relatively simple ritual, used to summon a certain spirit. This ritual, or "game", whatever you prefer calling will supposedly form a bond between you and your 4 friends that will last forever if done correctly. If not, the consequences will be dire. I live in Portugal, and this is not exactly a well-known ritual. I tried to look around the web for any page describing the ritual or giving instructions on how to do it, but didn't find any, so the only way to obtain information is through people who already know of it, or have attempted it, and that includes me. Personally, I've only tried this two times. The first time, I didn't get a response, and the second time, I made a critical mistake during the game. Keep in mind that this doesn't always work. Don't give up if you don't get any results the first time, but trying to perform the ritual more than 5 times is not recommended. With that said, let's get right into it! (This is a fairly lengthy post, by the way, but you have to do everything as exactly as I tell you here for it to work.)

Warnings:

* Performing this ritual in a lighthearted or skeptical mood may possibly be dangerous, as the spirit may not take this kindly. If you are skeptical about this whole deal but still choose to do it, try to keep it hidden.
* While you should not perform this ritual if you're skeptical about it, you should definitely not perform it if you are scared of it, or going through a rough patch in your life that leaves you psychologically vulnerable. The spirit will take advantage of this.
* Performing this ritual while intoxicated or under the effect of other drugs will most likely lead to a very terrible experience due to a number of factors. You may perform some crucial steps incorrectly, or you may anger the spirit.
* While this ritual has to be performed with friends, they are not allowed to say a single word, as it will enrage the spirit. However, they can write down things that they want you to say. It's fine as long as they don't speak.
* If you have pets, ask a friend or a trusted pet sitter to keep them overnight, as chances are they might mess everything up, and you don't want that.
* Keep the scissors and cleansing material on your person AT ALL TIMES.
* The game HAS to be performed in the house of whoever is hosting (the participant with the string around their finger).
* Do exactly as the instructions say.

Ingredients:

* 4 people willing to "play" with you;
* A room;
* 4 pieces of paper;
* Any sharp object used to draw blood;
* Any type of writing implement;
* Any container with water (may be a bucket, a bathtub, or even a hole);
* A relatively long piece of string (longer than 1 meter if possible);
* A small bell;
* An offering: this offering can either be an object with sentimental value, monetary value (don't offer actual currency though), alcohol (enough to make yourself drunk) or food (enough for one meal);
* A candle;
* Scissors;
* Salt, pine needles & sage, holy water, pepper, etc. Anything used to ward off spirits, in general.

Preparations:

* The game can be started as soon as the sun sets and you can no longer see it in the sky, and it immediately ends as soon as the sun begins to rise. In case it goes wrong, you can usually wait it out until morning. However keep in mind that if you simply wait it out and don't abort it correctly, consequences will eventually ensue.
* Turn off all the bright lights in your house. Dim lights are perfectly fine, as long as they aren't inside of the room where the summoning is taking place. The summoning room has to be absolutely dark (aside from the light of the candle). 
* Cover up every mirror and painting, and unplug every single electronic in your house to avoid seeing or hearing something nasty. Make sure there isn't any loose object, and if there is, store it somewhere.
* Lock EVERY SINGLE DOOR in the house, except for the door of the summoning room. Keep the keys on your person. This part is crucial.
* Fill up your preferred container with water. Any amount of water is OK, as long as the surface of the water is at least 5 inches or so above the bottom of the container. Put this container in the summoning room.
* Each one of the participants (except for the host) has to write their name on the piece of paper and put a couple droplets of their own blood on the paper and let it soak in.
* Tie the bell to one end of the string, and then tie the other end around your index finger.
* Pour some droplets of your own blood inside of the water container, and then put the offering inside of it too.
* Put the bell tied to the string inside of the bloody water.
* Once you are sure that you are ready, light the candle, go outside of the room and lock the door. This candle will serve as a beacon to the spirit. After this, the game can officially begin.

Starting the game:

* You will have to wait until the spirit decides to reveal itself. When this happens, you will feel a slight pull on the string. To bring forth the spirit, pull the string until it is out of the water. The bell will signal when it hits the ground. This step can take as little as just a few minutes, or as long as several hours. It might not even happen at all, if the spirit decides to not show up.
* As soon as the string is out of the water, wait for roughly 10 seconds. After this, introduce yourself, and each of your friends. If nothing happens, the game is on.

During the game:

* Each of your friends has to take a turn and slide their paper underneath the door. Wait for 10 minutes between each turn.
* For every paper that you slide under the door, something will happen. It might be the mirrors, it might be an electronic device. Do not actively look for anything that has changed in your house. If you hear a noise, do not try to find the source. Just don't panic, and keep in mind your friends are not allowed to make a single noise.
* After every paper is inside of the summoning room, you can finally end the game.

Finishing the game:

* Wait for at least 10 minutes after the last paper is inside the summoning room.
* After waiting, tell the spirit it was an honor to be in its presence, and tell it to leave your house, as it is no longer allowed in.
* After telling the spirit to leave, cut the string with the scissors. You may now go sleep if you wish, but keep the every single door in your house locked until morning. No one can leave the house, and no one can enter. No door can be opened.
* Once the sun rises, you may open the door to the summoning room. If the ritual was done correctly, the water in the container should be crystal clear, and the offering should be gone. Keep the other doors locked.
* You may open the door leading outside, and then proceed to drain the water, and dispose of the string by burning it. Bury the bell somewhere away from your house, and put salt and freshly burnt sage in the hole. Perform a cleansing ritual in your house.
* After this, you may open the doors in your house one by one. Carefully listen before opening, and if you don't hear anything, you can open it. Repeat this step until they are all unlocked. If you hear something, keep it locked. Repeat this every day.

What can go wrong:

* If you attempt the ritual more than 5 times and it doesn't work those 5 times, immediately cease your efforts. If the spirit doesn't want to show up, then it won't show up. Any further attempts might make it angry.
* Do not, under any circumstance, open the door or peep through the keyhole during the ritual. If you do, no amount of knowledge I have can save you.
* If instead of feeling a light pull on the string, you feel something tugging on it and violently pulling you, immediately cut the string, make a line of salt around the door and perform a cleansing ritual. Refer to "Finishing the game" section of this guide.
* If you tip over the water container, immediately cut the string, make a line of salt around the door and perform a cleansing ritual. Soak up any water that escapes from underneath the door and burn whatever tool you used to do so. If you can't burn it, bury it far away from your home in a hole. Put salt and freshly burnt sage in the hole. Refer to "Finishing the game" section of this guide.
* If you hear a noise after introducing your friends, or feel something pulling on the string, immediately cut the string, make a line of salt around the door and perform a cleansing ritual. Refer to "Finishing the game" section of this guide.
* Unlocking the doors before morning is a terrible mistake.

Edit: some grammar mistakes corrected

Thanks! The second time I tried this I was relatively nervous, just like the first time. While pulling the string, I accidentally tipped over the water bucket that we were using. Throughout the rest of the night I had a lingering feeling of severe anxiety that I couldn't shake off, and none of us slept. One of the night lights that we were using next to us kept going out, and we started hearing whispering at some point. At about 4-5 AM (we had an analog clock on us, which I greatly recommend if you do this) one of the doorknobs began moving on its own. It was pretty unnoticeable at first, but it got gradually more violent, and the spirit, or whatever was doing that gave up after about 30 seconds. We proceeded as the post states once it was morning, shortly after 7 AM. Personally, I'd rather never try it again. Edit: corrected a typo

You have to tell the spirit your first and last name, same thing with all of your friends. I suppose you could tell it your full name, although I probably think it'd be best not to. Regarding the paper, your friends have to write their first and last name as well.

Severing a Link to a Former Love - finding it hard to move on after a break-up? This should help. 1 player.

[RECIPE] Severing a link to a former love

This is a ritual I came across a few decades ago and adapted for my own use. It's basically a personal anti-love spell of sorts, but more of a transformative step to prepare your mind to move on with your life. What you will be doing is very safe and carries no risks with it in it's current state. This is intended to be used months after a rough breakup where you feel an inability to move on, where you still feel connected to the other person. This ritual is intended to sever that link. To those of you that are skeptics, I invite you to treat this as a mental exercise rather than a mystical one. Think of it as a meditative experience that involves your subconscious.

What you'll need is a shower, or a bathroom with a tub. Make sure that you're alone since this ritual requires you to focus on the element of water. Also, you'll need a scented soap of some kind, choose a fragrance that makes you feel at ease. It doesn't matter what kind of soap it is, liquid or bar makes no difference. Now, each culture has it's own elemental deity of water, so do some research and find one that resonates with you. I chose the ideal of Undine myself as names aren't really important, but they help with the ritual since it gives you a personification to adress. Some people like turning out the lights and lighting candles and if you feel that makes it more cozy for you, then by all means do so. It isn't required though, but it does help set the mood for some people.

Then go into your shower or bathtub and immerse yourself in water in a temperature you find enjoyable. Then try and feel the water, not just as the random molecules they are, but as an energy flowing around you. This can take some time because most of us aren't used to treating water as anything other than.. water. As you start to relax and feel more in tune with this element, simply say that you are seeking guidance in matters of love. Say that you are seeking the element of water and that you want to be cleansed of another person that's been in your life.

After a while, you will start to feel an increasing presence around you. Then you simply adress the ditety by name and say that you wish to cleanse yourself of the other persons energies and that you wish to sever the link between you two. After saying that, take a moment to relax and clear your mind. Then ask "Am I ready to cleanse myself of this person?" The manner in which you get a reply is different for everyone. Some have heard it in their mind, others have felt it as a non-verbal change in energies and some have even heard a voice. If you get a no, you may ask why you're not ready and you'll find out.

If you get a positive answer, say thank you and start washing your body whole body slowly and deliberately with your soap of choice. While you're scrubbing down, recite to yourself this affirmation:

"I cleanse my body of you [ex lovers name here], I cleanse my spirit of you. With this act I sever the link that has been between us in the past. With this cleansing, I will move on with my life as you no longer have a place in it. If I ever meet you again, we shall be as strangers once more because our bond is hereby broken. All that I have shared with you, I reclaim, all that I reclaim will empower me once more."

Now, contrary to the last statement, I've often felt somewhat drained after performing this ritual, so I've chosen to do this late at night and then gone to bed afterwards. The day after you've completed this ritual, you can examine your own feelings around your previous relationship and if successful, you should feel a newfound sense of finality and closure to it. As for me, I always wake up the day after and feel really energized and relieved.

If you get interrupted in the ritual, by noisy neighbours, parents, kids, pets or whatever, just simply resolve to try it another time when you're alone. There is no danger in being interrupted here. If anyone uses this ritual, I would be interested in what happens for you, so please share it with us on this sub :)

Edit: Also, as someone has seen fit to rip off my post, I figured I'd prove my ownership by editing this post and linking to my blog which has an updated version of it:

I honestly hope you won't have to, it's one of the worst real life events you can experience. (Having a relation go bad, not the ritual itself!)

I'll definitely be trying this. Does it work for all negative relationship ties, or just romantic ones?

[Recipe] Crossroads

Requirements:

A skill you wish to master (i.e Guitar, Drums, Dancing)

A nearby Crossroads - a dusty dirt road intersection works best but any will do -

An item related to your chosen skill

10 Free Nights

Ritual:

Bring your item of choice to the crossroads at sometime before midnight. Practice your skill of choice for the next hour(s) or so. You must repeat this process for 10 consecutive midnights. You should be greeted by a different black animal(s) each night. On the final night you will be greeted by a Black Man. Give him your item of choice. If it is a guitar he will tune it, play it then return it to you. Once the item is back in your hand you gain instant mastery of said skill.

This is what Robert Johnson was said to have done for his amazing guitar skills. OP really should have mentioned that the trade-off (popularly described) was that Robert sold his soul to he devil and died at an early age.

The Answer Man [Recipe]

This recipe was copied from The Ghost in my Machine. It is not my own work. EDIT: Formatting

Players

    10 participants.

Requirements

    10 cell phones. Burner phones are recommended (see: Ending The Call, Step 4).

Instructions

    Making The Call:

-Begin at any time and in any place.

    Gather all 10 participants in a circle.

    Each participant should give their phone number to the person to their right — that is, each participant should be able to call the person to their left.

    On the count of three, all participants should call the person to their left.

    If all 10 participants receive a busy signal or the call goes to voicemail: The ritual has failed; do not proceed. If this outcome emerges, try again later.

    If nine participants receive a busy signal or the call goes to voicemail: The ritual has succeeded; you may proceed. If this outcome emerges, one participant’s phone call — and only one — will be answered. This participant will hear a voice begin to speak on the other end.

The Conversation

    The participant whose call was successful may ask the Answer Man a question.

    The participant should listen carefully to the answer.

    After the Answer Man has given his answer, he will in turn ask a question of the participant.

    The participant MUST answer this question. The answer must be honest, truthful, and correct.

    The participant may repeat this process as many times as they like.

Ending The Call

    When the participant has received all the information they require, they may end the call by telling the Answer Man they must go.

    The Answer Man may attempt to keep the participant on the line, possibly by offering information for free. Do NOT stay on the line. The participant should repeatedly state their need to end the conversation.

    If the participant is persistent, the Answer Man will say good-bye and hang up. At this point, the call has been terminated.

    After the call has been terminated, immediately destroy all cell phones used to conduct the ritual.

Additional Notes

    It is recommended that participants save the phone numbers required for Making The Call, Steps 3 and 4 to their contacts list for easy dialing.

    It is recommended that one participant be designated the “Counter”; this person will issue the countdown signaling when the phone numbers should be dialed in Making The Call, Step 4. It is also recommended that this person clarify, in advance, what “on the count of three” means: That is, whether all participants press “call” as the number three is spoken, or whether all participants press “call” in the moment immediately after the number three is spoken.

    It is NOT recommended that participants who have successfully called the Answer Man pass the phone around the circle or allow multiple participants to ask questions. There’s a reason the Answer Man picked up that particular call; he’s not content to talk to just anybody.

    It is NOT recommended that you put the Answer Man on speaker phone.

    Do NOT fail to destroy all cell phones used to conduct the ritual as soon as possible after the ritual’s completion. Even if you’ve hung up — or even if you were among the nine who were unable to connect in the first place — you never know what might try to call you back.

Concerning The Answer Man’s Offer

Do NOT accept the Answer Man’s offer for free information in exchange for staying on the line. He is a master at exploiting loopholes; he will find a way to ask you a question, and he will find a way to make it a requirement for you to answer that question. When this question comes, it will be far more difficult than any of his preceding questions; indeed, it will likely be impossible to answer. Should you fail to answer — as he intends by extending this offer — see below.

Concerning The Answer Man’s Questions

    Do not fail to answer the Answer Man’s questions. Do not lie, either directly or by omission. Do not answer falsely. Do not answer incorrectly. If you fail to answer any question put to you by the Answer Man, you may feel a mild tingling sensation in a particular part of your body — a finger, a toe, a hand, a leg; anything is fair game. This is how you will know you have failed; this is the price of your failure.

    And when, some days or months or even years on, you lose that part of your body — by accident, by illness, or by some other means — you will know that he has collected his fee.

A Final Note

Do not hang up on the Answer Man. He doesn’t like that.

Posted byu/[deleted]3 years ago
The White Kimono [Recipe]

The White Kimono recipe was copied from The Ghost in my Machine. This is not my original work. EDIT: Formatting

Players

    One principal.

Requirements

    A dark room with precisely four corners — no more, no less. The curtains should be drawn, and all sources of exterior light pollution should be eliminated.

    A light source with an easy-to-operate switch.

    A compass. Optional, but recommended if your sense of direction is somewhat lacking.

Instructions

    Begin after midnight. Between two and three o’clock in the morning is suggested.

    Go to your room, close the door, and lie down on your back. The lights should be on, but arranged such that they will be easy to turn off from your current position. (A small lamp positioned near your location of repose is ideal.) Your gaze should be focused on the ceiling.

    Turn your gaze to the northernmost corner of the room.

    Shift your gaze to the westernmost corner of the room.

    Shift your gaze to the southernmost corner of the room.

    Shift your gaze to the easternmost corner of the room.

    Repeat Steps 3 through 6 two more times, gazing at each corner in turn, moving counterclockwise, for a total of three circuits around the room.

    Cross your arms on your chest.

    Repeat the following words three times: “On be iroki yamashironi sowaka.”

    In your mind’s eye, picture a woman. She has long black hair, and she is dressed in a white kimono — or at least, it would be white, if it weren’t for the fact that it is heavily stained. The stain is red, a rusty red that invites terrible thoughts.

    She is walking towards you. She is still walking towards you. She is getting closer. She is very close. She is right before you.

    Uncross your arms.

    Turn off the lights.

    Go to sleep.

The Dream

    If you see the woman in your dream, the invitation was successful. You may appreciate her presence; however, DO NOT:

    Speak to her. Tell her your name. Let her whisper anything in your ear.

    If she begins whispering in your ear: Wake up immediately. Shaking your right hand in your dream is recommended; however, if you are skilled at lucid dreaming, you may use whichever method for waking yourself up you find to be the most effective.

The Awakening

    Upon waking, examine the corners of the room. Do you see a shadow lurking in any of them? A shadow which should not be there? No? Then you are safe.

    Do not attempt this ritual again.

Additional Notes

    It is recommended that all players develop skills in lucid dreaming before attempting this ritual.

If You See A Shadow In The Room Upon Waking:

    Turn the lights on immediately. Do not allow yourself to be alone in the dark again. Ever.

If You Are Unable To Wake Yourself Up: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

They note that at the top. They're reposting outside sources they've used in Ritual Index 2 to the subreddit so that 1. Redditors are less at risk from having to go to an external link (viruses and whatnot, I guess?) And 2. So that in the event that the external source is changed or removed, users will still be able to access it here.

Sever the Cord [Recipe]

The Sever the Cord recipe is from Creepypasta. This ritual is not my own work.

Many have speculated that the plane in which we live is not the only plane in existence. Those who say this will usually then go on to ponder realms of mystery and wonder. The truth is, there is a second plane, but it is not filled with the euphoric images that most people conjure up. However, it is not filled with horrors either, rather, it is a perfect emulation of our world. There is no difference at all. Whatever exists in our plane also exists on the Second Plane. Even you exist on the Second Plane. In fact, those “copies” of ourselves, those extra-dimensional clones, are bonded to us. Whatever action we take, they take, and vice versa. That means that, in the other plane, that other you is reading this right now.

In this Second Plane, there is only one difference. A God resides there, though some may call him a Devil, watching over the mirrors of those in Our Realm. This God has no mirror. He resides only in the Second Plane. Our “Copies” cannot see him, either, for unknown reasons. But he can see them. He knows what they are doing. Therefore, he knows what YOU are doing. There is only one way to escape this constant watching, but it could come at a terrible price.

Stand before a mirror. You see your reflection? That is your Copy. Look him straight in the eye, and will with all of your might that what you see before you is not YOU; rather, it is a perfect emulation of you. As soon as you have made this mental breakthrough, turn off the lights. Wait a while, about two minutes should do. Then, turn them back on. Your reflection will be gone. You have just severed the bond between you and your Copy. You can no longer see him, but he exists. Now, however, you will be free to do as you please, without your Copy mirroring it, and without the God knowing what you are doing. You could murder a thousand people, and walk without fear of retribution.

However, it is not recommended that you do this. As you sever the bond, the same decay that affected the bond will eat slowly up the remnants of one side of the “cord”. As it reaches whichever you was on that particular side, it will begin to eat away at its soul. Whichever version of you is effected will become sicker, paler. It will stink of death, its movements will become stiff. As it nears the final stages of this illness, it will become merely a shadow of itself.

It becomes a ghost. Cursed to forever roam whatever existence it resides in, a shattered soul and lost cause. However, if it is not you that is affected by this illness, but your Copy, you will walk free. You will walk without judgment. You will be a God among men.

But be careful, for if that disease eats up your side of the cord, you will fall prey to its effects.

Trust me. I know.

Lights Out: A Beginners Guide to Playing

Preface

To preface this beginners guide and rulebook on the game of “Lights Out”, the author discourages any individuals from initiating or participating in this game. With that being said, this guide serves to assist those brave and moronic individuals who will, nevertheless, attempt this dangerous game whether or not they are knowledgeable of the rules, risks, and rewards

Introduction

The “Lights Out” game has been referred to by many other names. Some more common names include: “Lights Off”, “Light Switch”, “Room Wars”, or simply, “Switch”. No matter the title you may be familiar with, the rules of the game remain the same. Before we begin an explanation and brief history of the game, the author would like to once again warn against participation. Persons with pre-existing medical conditions, the elderly, children, and pregnant women are highly discouraged from playing. Only those individuals of fit body and sound mind should consider attempting “Lights Out”, and only if said individuals understand the inherent risks.

Overview

The objective of Lights Out is a simple one. Two players are assigned either to lights on, or lights out. The players then race around an assigned building switching room lights either on or off. The game ends when either side manages to turn all lights in the house on or off. If the player tasked with turning the lights on manages to illuminate all rooms in the house, that player wins. If the lights out player manages to turn off all switches in the house, that player wins. It should be noted that even though this is a two player game, only you, the reader/participant, are actually playing. What is simply called “player two” will be discussed later in this guide. For now let us move on to a brief history of the game.

History

The history of this game is an obscure one, to say the least. Although nobody knows the exact origin of Light’s Out, reports of this game being played date back as early as the commercialization of the light bulb. Journal entries from several countries in the early twentieth century indicate this game, or games similar to this one, being played worldwide in the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia. A correlation can be found between an uptick in references to the “Light’s Out” game during times of war and famine. This is hypothesized to be the case because of the unique and highly valuable award granted to those individuals who find success at “Lights Out”.

Sometime during the mid-twentieth century the game fell into obscurity. This is not to say that the game had been common knowledge, or popular during its history, but instead, the game fell from relative obscurity into complete obscurity. Very few references to this game exist from the 1950s onward to the present. The author has several theories as to why this may be the case, but for the sake of staying concise, it will not be discussed in this guide. Lights Out has since existed underground in niche communities from Wicca to deep web forums. This guide is intended for members of these communities who know or have heard of this game. Readers who only now know of this game due to this article should stop reading immediately and refrain from pursuing anything related to this game.

The Players

As previously stated, Lights Out is a two player game. If you choose to participate in the game you will be named player one. This is because player one always initiates the game. As player one you are able to decide the play area, as well as make appropriate changes to this area. You are also able to choose which side you will be on (It is recommended to choose lights on, as choosing lights out will find you running around in the dark for the duration of the game).You may also choose the starting location of player two.

Player two, hereby referred to as it, is to be summoned into the room you have chosen. Summoning procedure will be outlined below. It may not be seen by player one but may be felt, often as a cold flash, and sometimes as a hot flash. Reports often site an unpleasant odor of rotting fruit or garbage when player two is present. Player two follows the same rules as player one during the game. However, just as player one has a few advantages during the set up procedure of the game; it has been noted as having its own distinct advantages during the game itself. This too will be discussed later.

The importance of this player introduction is to understand the differences between you and the entity known as player two, or it. Begin to think about the importance of the setup procedure and how it may influence the outcome of the game.

Rules

The rules of Lights Out are fairly straight forward. As of the writing of this guide, there exist seven rules. This section of the guide shall be formatted as a set list.

    The game may only be played between the hours of 12 am to 4 am

    The play area must consist of a closed off building containing multiple rooms and/or hallways all with light sources and electricity.

    For a building to qualify as a play area, it must have at least 8 separate rooms and/or hallways.

    The participant must be alone during the setup of the game as well as the duration of the game. Failure to follow this rule results in an automatic loss.

    The game must start with an even number of rooms lit and unlit. If the number of rooms is an odd number, a coin may be flipped to determine the status of the final room.

    Once the game begins it does not end until one player has turned on/off all lights in the building.

    Use of any machine or contraption to give one an advantage during the game is prohibited and will result in an automatic loss.

Preparation

If one wishes to participate in Lights Out then a fair amount of preparation work is needed. Many factors should be taken into consideration for beginning the game. Perhaps the most important factor is the building that will serve as the game space. It is known that the arena must contain at least 8 rooms. What may not be known to some individuals is that there is no limit to the number of rooms a play area may contain. This means that a mansion is within the boundaries of the game so long as all other conditions are met. This too means that a hundred story office tower is viable for the same reasons.

It is not advisable to choose a building with too many rooms; most participants would not have the physical capability to sprint around such large areas for an extended period of time. Because of this it is recommended that player one pick an arena with no more than 12 rooms. This will ensure faster rounds with less fatigue. A room is any area within the building closed off with at least four walls, a floor, a roof, an entrance/exit, and a source of light able to be manipulated. This includes bedrooms, bathrooms, garages, and walk in closets. A light source may range from a fixed overhead light-bulb to a standing lamp. An open kitchen does not constitute a room. If a closet does not have a light source it does not constitute a room. If there is a separate building on the property unattached to the play area it does not constitute a room. Many small to medium sized homes fit within this player made restriction. It is advisable that the player picks a place that is familiar to them, be it their own house or a friend’s/family member’s house.

When the arena is decided it is time to prepare the space. Remove all items within the building that may hinder you from easy access to a light switch. This may mean moving furniture against walls or completely removing it from the premises. Door wedges may be used to hold open doors for easier access to rooms. Ensure all light switches within the building are working as intended. Make a mental map of all these switches so that even in the event of total darkness you can still navigate all rooms.

Consider timing yourself as you run from room to room switching lights on and off. If circumstances permit, you may wish to play a practice round against a friend or family member. I cannot offer you advice on how to convince others to play against you but it is an invaluable tool that should be considered.

Set-Up

Assuming you the player have appropriately prepared your arena, it is now time to detail the set-up procedure. It is recommended the reader familiarize and internalize this section of the guide even if this means reading this section again. This is because the set-up of the game is more than half the battle and a properly set-up arena will increase the chances of survival. Though this game requires above average fitness, it also requires a strategic mind. The process of set-up is a complicated procedure. The game will not commence until all requirements of the set-up procedure are satisfied.

The first order of set-up is to choose the time you wish to play. As previously stated in rule one, the game may only be played between the hours of 12 am to 4 am. Many cite the hypothesis of the “witching hour” to explain this window of time. Regardless, it is recommended that you start the game as soon as possible. Previous players of Lights Out report a direct relationship between the time of night and the difficulty of the game. Starting at the stroke of midnight, or as close to it as possible will ensure a better chance at success. If one desires a challenge they may start between the hours of 1 am to 2 am. 2:05 am is the latest recorded time an individual has started the game and successfully completed it. There exist a myriad of individuals who have strived to beat this record; however, there exist no reports of successful completion after 2:05 am. It should be noted that even after the game starts, difficulty will increase as time increases. This means that the game must be completed as soon as possible after commencement.

Another factor to take into consideration is the weather. Though the entirety of the game will take place away from the elements, the weather may still have an effect on the game. Avoid playing during a severe thunder or snow storm. Loss of power during a game will result in a win for the lights out player (commonly it). To this end, also avoid playing in an area with frequent power outages.

Once the starting time has been chosen you must make sure that only you are in the house during that time. All doors and windows to the outside must be shut and locked securely. Once this has been ensured it is now time to choose a personal item. This item must have value to you. Do not worry; this item will not be sacrificed. Place this item in the room you wish it to spawn in. Once this has been done you may switch the lights on or off. If its starting room is left lit, it will be assigned to lights on, the opposite is true if the light is turned out (Again, it is recommended to assign it the lights out). It is now time to set up the configuration of lit and unlit rooms. They may be spaced and shaped in any patterns so long as the fifth rule of the game is followed.

When this has been done, write down on a piece of paper one desire that you have. This may be anything from material wealth to love, fame, or knowledge. It is important that this desire not be unattainable or impossible. Raising the dead, time travel, unassisted flight, or future vision are examples of impossible desires. Remember, it must be possible and it must be desired. When you have finished writing this down, place the written statement in the room you wish to start in. Your starting room may be in any room that is oppositely lit from its starting room.

The incantation and ritual is now ready to be performed. Return to its starting room to perform the summoning ritual. The incantation and ritual will not be detailed in this guide. This is to discourage any mildly curious persons from participating in this game. If one really wishes to play Lights Out they may search for the ritual and incantation. It has been covered and documented a multiple of times and exists both on and off the internet. The only requirement to finding the incantation and ritual is patience and a strong desire to participate.

When you have completed the incantation and ritual you now have sixty seconds to find your way back to your starting room. If you are found in a room that is not your starting room (the room with your written statement) the game will not begin and the ritual must be performed again. If the game still will not start then you have done something wrong in the set-up procedure. You may re-perform the set-up procedure as many times until the game begins but it is advised that one wait until the next night so as not to start the game too late.

Playing the Game

You will know the game has started when all lights in the house flicker once. Do not be alarmed, this only happens to signal the start and end of the game. If the flickering persists during the game, that is due to a mechanical failure and not the game.

When the game starts it is time to run. You must run as fast as possible around the arena flicking lights on. Do not stop running until the game has finished. If a room has multiple light sources you only have to turn one on for a room to be counted as lit. Though you must be quick, do not be too quick that you injure yourself. Spraining an ankle, acquiring a concussion, or falling down the stairs will not help your chances of success. It will not wait for you to recover and the game does not stop until it is over.

You will notice the lights from consecutive rooms turning off; this is it. You will not be able to see it but you may be able to sense it. A feeling of unease or dread is oftentimes felt by those who stand or pass through a room containing it. If you should feel this during the game there is no need to panic, it will not harm you during the game. Previous players have noted that at the beginning of the game it may take it anywhere from two to five seconds to turn a room light off. As the game progresses the time it takes for it to turn lights off decreases. This may be because of the relationship between the time of night and the difficulty of the game or it may be it familiarizing itself with the layout of the building. If one starts the game much later than midnight then it will be significantly faster. Past 1:45 am it has been noted as taking less than a second to turn a room light off.

It is ideal to complete the game within the first five minutes because of this increase in difficulty as the game draws out. Though you may start to feel fatigue within the first five to thirty minutes (depending on level of fitness), it has never been reported to show signs of exhaustion. As previously stated, it will only continue to become faster as the game progresses. Any game that lasts longer than fifteen minutes is often a lost cause. Do not let this discourage you however, the longest reported game by a successful player lasted thirty eight minutes.

You will know the game has ended when the lights flicker once again. The entirety of the house will either be lit or unlit. You will know if you have won based on what happens next.

Winning Conditions

Congratulations, you have won. Return to your starting room to find that your written statement has disappeared. You may be tempted to sit back and wait for your wish to come true, however, this is not the case. Whatever your desire, it will not be handed to you. Instead, you will find opportunities in pursuit of your goal that you will not have found before. New doors will open to you and your dream will be more easily attainable than it was previously. This conclusion stems from interviews with several successful actors, CEO’s, musicians, and artists, all alleged winners of Lights Out. Personal accounts from a few historical figures in history also serve to show the conditions of winning.

Again, congratulations, you may rest easy knowing what the future holds for you.

Losing Conditions

Not much is known about the terms of losing Lights Out. This is because those who lose are not available to be interviewed or documented. How is it known that someone has lost Lights Out? This information can be gleamed through any audio, video, and writings of the person prior to participating in the game. If the person has expressed a desire or committed to playing the game, and has not been heard from since, it is believed that this person has failed Lights Out. The vast majority of those who have lost are missing persons. Few bodies have ever been recovered; those that have have been ruled as apparent accidents or suicides.

By reading officer reports, one may gleam what has happened to those who lose. One case found a woman at the foot of her stairs, her neck and spine having been broken in several places. It is unclear whether this was due to an accident during the game, or a condition of losing. Another case found the body of a man strewn across the pavement five floors below his apartment. Again, it is unknown whether the man was flung from his apartment after losing, or, faced with the impossibility of winning, threw himself out of the window to avoid the consequences of losing. Either way, those whose bodies have been discovered after an unsuccessful attempt at Lights Out have surely been shown mercy compared to those persons who have vanished.

A popular theory is held within the community as to the whereabouts of those players who have lost. Many believe that those who did not find success have been doomed to become it. These players having been taken, stripped of their form and substance, and forced to eternally play the game. Again, this is only speculation, and nothing has been proven or disproved as to the whereabouts of those who have lost. In the end it does not really matter what happened to those who lost; what matters is that you do not find out.

Conclusion

Lights Out is not a game to be handled lightly. The consequences of losing are severe and quite possibly fatal. The author hopes that with this description of the game, possible players are discouraged from taking part in the game. However, as with many illegal activities, persons will continue to do so despite the inherent risks. In this regard the author hopes that this guide has helped any individuals who have made up their mind to play this dangerous game. There are many more aspects of Lights Out that fall outside the scope of this guide. If one wishes to know more they only need to search for it.

Hello. I checked online at ritual websites and witchcraft websites, and I couldn't find anything that even matched the description of this ritual. I also searched every name of it you posted at the top to no avail. Can you dm me the incantation? I have studied and practiced this stuff for almost 30 years since I was a child (my mother was a witch for decades before she converted to jw ) and am interested in the incantation used, and also the origins of this if possible.

What if you chose off for your side and did it in an area prone to black outs during a thunder storm? Sure you'd have to risk the power not getting cut but leaving it to the odds of nature seems like a legitimate strategy.

Well the way I see it, planning for something that doesn't leave it up to chance would be seen as cheating,but if you played in a certain kind of condition I think it could be considered a luck of the draw since there's a chance the power wouldn't get cut by the storm.

Here is some food for thought. What if one were to choose light on, and then, upon realizing that their defeat is imminent, runs to the closest switch and forcefully holds the switch in the on position until 4 am, thus forcing a draw.

I bet they would feel the feeling of dread the whole time as "it" tries to turn the light off haha, or maybe "it" would try to break the bulb or something, I feel like that would be cheating though.

Why does it say not to keep reading if you only just found out about it through the article? (i didn't read past that sentence, I just scrolled to the comments immediately without looking because I don't want to play the game.) There's a nosleep creepypasta called "the soul game" that also pulls the "knowing all the rules makes you a player" plot twist trick, and it's a good story but I already knew it was fictional because the commenters on the YouTube video weren't telling everyone to click away (which they would be if listening through to the end had made them part of the game)

    Boatman Ritual Purpose: Escape to a new life. Players: 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/GeoronimoTheThird
4 years ago
The Boatman Ritual

You hear about a lot of rituals you can carry out when you read stories on the Internet. Some involve going to particular places, some lighting candles on front of mirrors or games of chance. Most of them have the aim of learning, gaining knowledge, whether about yourself, the future or other planes of existence.

But the ritual most people don't know, is the one to make you disappear. To vanish in the night, from all your problems, fears, and troubles. The ritual of the boatman.

If you're in a position from which you cannot escape, abuse from family, people who want to find you and will stop at nothing, all of it can be simply left behind. Well, maybe not ‘simply’, but we'll get to that.

I put this ritual out there, not because I want to scare people, but because I want to help people, that's what it's for really. Though, I must stress, well and truly, that if you do try this, it is not easy, or for the faint of heart. It is most definitely not for those who ever wish to see their old lives ever again, their friends or family, you must be willing, to leave it all behind.

First you require something gold, a ring, a necklace, electrical parts will even work, you just need a few grams of solid gold.

Go to the closest body of water, it doesn't matter whether it's flowing or not, as long as it stretches out of view in some direction, not a pond, but a lake, a river, even the sea, these will all work, as long as it's night. The boatman will not come in the light of day, or if you are not alone, he and you are to disappear without a trace, and onlookers will not be tolerated.

Stand at the water's edge, stretch out your arm, and drop your object into the inky black surface of the water. DO NOT look up, instead watch it hit the water, your reflection may be barely visible depending on the darkness, but as the water laps and the object splashes, making waves, stare at your visage in the water. Think, let everything you wish to leave fill your mind, your friends, your family, your job, your reputation, everything you're escaping. As best you can, push those thoughts into your reflection as it distorts, and if you truly wish to leave, and trust me, he will know if you do not, you'll see the water become clear and undisturbed.

The surface will turn still and glass like, even the breeze will die. Wait several seconds before looking up, chances are everything will be ok, but should you look up and see the boatman arriving into this world from another, you'll see horrors far beyond this world too, things that will break your mind, they mortals are not ever supposed to see.

If you fulfil all the requirements up to this point however, he will come to you. Depending on the how much light there is, you may well hear him before you see him. You will hear the regular slap of his paddle into the water, slow and rhythmic, and the water swilling around it as it pushes the boat through the glassy water.

He will arrive in all black, hooded and robed. Don't try to see his face, for whatever reason, he does not allow any to know his identity, and should they, he will take you somewhere much further away than you intend to go, somewhere from which none return, an eternal void.

Enter his watercraft, a small wooden rowboat, old and damaged, but still just about staying afloat. You should sit upon its single wooden seat, and allow the boatman to row you into the darkness.

As the boat moves you'll soon see that where it stretched out of view, there is now something else. It will open up into an enormous expanse of open water, how far it truly stretches, I'm afraid I do not know. You will likely soon see the water become… less water like.

The boatman will light the small lamp on the stern, and by its small light you will be able to see that the water is now thick, and red. You may see pieces of gore floating amidst the water's surface, but pay no mind. You may even see a pale body floating in the surface, but certainly do not reach out to touch them, or pull them aboard, even if they look at you, or beg for help. Should you do so, the very moment your fingers touch the water, they will grab you, those who have fallen victim to the waters, they will be more than happy to drag you down, and initiate you amongst their ranks. You will see their bony, skeletal hands, black gunk and weeds wrapped around their knuckles, and they will pull you in by your wrists, down into the murky depths.

After a while you'll begin to see it on the horizon, the ruined city. If it is more than an island upon the bloody sea, I'm afraid I cannot tell you one way or the other, but it clearly used to be more than it now is. I've heard many theories on the city's origin, some say it was once a grand city built by other dimensional beings, that was met by calamity in the form of eternal darkness, an evil creeping darkness that infested the citizens. Some have said it was built by men, in a time long lost, that somehow found their way here before something made them disappear. Some say the citizens drowned themselves in the water, and that is why so many souls reside in the crimson tide. None I have spoken to have anything more than theories, so should anyone find any information, I'd love to hear it.

Whatever the case, the city now stands in the eternal dark, no sun in the sky. Only a strange dim light that covers everything, allowing you to make out the buildings that reach into the sky as finger-like monoliths, wrapped in fog. The architecture, is modern, as though it were made in the early 1900s, though stories of it come from before that era, so this is surely impossible.

The boatman will guide you between the buildings, through the canals that extend throughout its streets, as if in place of roads. It is possible to leap from the safety of the boat to to these streets, and I have heard that some managed to wander through the buildings, and make it back onto the boat before it left the city, and you became stuck there, as a lost soul. They say that the buildings clearly contain electric lighting and appliances, though it all fails to run when turned on. One man said he saw a light that spoke to him, infecting his mind with thoughts of leaping into the depths for safety. Another man even showed me a book he claimed he found in the city. Having read it, it's hundred or so pages simply contain a repeat of one poem, over and over again, simply reading:

‘Jack wished to become the sky, But the depths told him a lie, The lights wanted to save him, But they they showed him their true name, Now jack looks sad, And the depths call his name.’

The place is also filled with lost souls, people who failed to make it back to the boatman. You may well see them as you make your way through the canals, see them looking at you through windows and darting away. If you do see them, be on alert, they want nothing more than to escape, and there's only one space on that boat. Should any attempt to make it on board, the boatman will take no note, and you'll have no choice than to wrestle them into the water, where they will be dragged away, but be sure not to touch it yourself, of course.

If you do make it through, you'll arrive at the heart of the city, a huge octagonal building, gargoyles looking out from it, the bloody water pouring from their mouths. in which all the canals meet. It appears to have once been intended for easy travel, but now the twenty metre or so wide pool at its heart was replaced by an enormous, ever circling whirlpool. It will take hold of the boat and drag it down, spinning violently into its heart.

When you are close enough to its heart, you will be able to look over the edge of the boat, and see that the middle of the whirlpool drops into oblivion, disappearing into an abyss. The boatman will stand, turn to you, reach out to you, his hands still covered by his robe, and throw you down into the heart.

You'll fall, down into the dark, the pinprick of light above disappearing, and surrounded by silence.

When you come to, you'll find yourself somewhere else. Far, far away from your start, with a home, money and a job, a new identity. Enough to start again. However, there is one more cost. When you awake, you'll be missing a finger. First will be the ring finger on your right hand, if you wanted another trip, next is you index finger, then your left ring finger. Should you have no fingers, he will accept other things, toes, ears, tongues, eyes. But that's his toll, flesh.

Should you attempt to locate your family or friends they will not recognise you, and will rapidly meet with a grizzly end. They will found in pieces, like they were torn apart my some horrifying beast, or they perhaps burst, sending pieces of them flying. One man told me his mother was at the supermarket when she was found by another store customer, bits of her wildly hanging from the shelves and blood filling the aisle. She silently, and instantaneously was… shredded.

This is the Boatman's Ritual, and I seriously suggest you don't do this for a laugh, or to test it's accuracy. The boatman will know if you are apprehensive, he always knows. But, if you need to escape, the boatman is more than willing, for a price.

You know, I wouldn't mind giving up a finger or two in exchange for a life free of chronic depression and crippling anxiety. Heck old Boatman can have my entire hand. It seems like a small price to pay.

Oh dance the Boatman dance.

Oh dance all night till the broad daylight

So, I love this. But I have questions and maybe you'd be able to help?

    Can one sit facing away from the Boatman?

    You said people have told you about being there and showed you stuff, so I'm assuming He doesn't do anything if you write or talk about it? Just wanted to clarify that one.

    What if one were to do this ritual and then write about it and write about their old life and then someone from their old life somehow remembers and then seeks them out, do they still get shredded?

Just super curious.

Really awesome ritual, though. Thanks for posting!

Interesting questions

    Yes you can face away, leave the boat and so forth

    There's no problem with sharing the ritual or anything from the city

    I honestly have no idea, I don't think I've ever heard of that happening organically like that. I'd be very interested to know myself

    Snowman Ritual Origin: Ukraine and south Russia. Purpose: Gain protection over an aspect of your life for one year. Players: 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Snowman Ritual

The following is a set of instructions on how to perform the Snowman Ritual.

This is a “peace and prosperity” ritual to be performed during the winter months in order to obtain favor and protection throughout the coming year, and will take three days to complete fully.

The earliest written accounts of this ritual date back to the 4th century CE in greater Scythia (now Ukraine and southernmost Russia). This translation has adapted the original materials used and the wording of the incantations to be more accessible for modern societies. Despite these changes, recent attempts suggest that the correctly-performed rite is still very effective.

Tradition dictates that this ritual be performed in the days between Christmas Eve (or the winter solstice) and New Year’s Day, but in theory, it should be effective during any cold period where there is sufficient snowfall. This ritual works best for farmers and homeowners who keep livestock and/or pets. Urban apartment-dwellers can attempt it, but will have a much harder time ensuring that the ritual is not interrupted or disturbed during the three-day duration.

WARNING: For your own safety, please read the entire document before attempting this ritual.

You will need:

    Snow coverage of at least three (3) inches, with temperatures near or below freezing over a three (3) day period

    Two (2) tree branches or wooden sticks, preferably forked at one end

    String or rubber bands

    Plant material, such as dead leaves or dried grass

    Vegetable oil, such as canola or olive oil

    Animal material, such as a strip of leather, clump of fur, cluster of feathers, etc.

    Animal blood, such as cow or pig’s blood (this can be purchased at your local butcher shop or supermarket)

    Scissors

    A sterilized needle

    A lock of your hair

    A drop of your blood

Instructions:

At the edge of your property, build a snowman. It must be at least as tall as you are, so be sure to set aside the time and energy necessary, or enlist family or friends to help you. Ensure that the front of the snowman is facing away from your house. Use the tree branches on either side to form the snowman’s arms, but do not give it a face. That will come later.

At sundown, take the plant material, the vegetable oil, and the string or rubber bands out to the snowman. Facing the snowman (you should be looking at your house over its shoulder), secure the plant materials to its left hand (your right hand) with the string or rubber bands.

Dip your finger into the vegetable oil and press the finger into its left side of the face (your right side). This is the snowman’s left eye.

As you do this, recite the following:

    Snowman, Snowman

    See my land

    Hallowed soil on which we stand

    Snowman, Snowman

    Bless my home

    Guide me back if e’er I roam

Afterwards, return to your house. Lock the door, draw the curtains, and go to bed before midnight. If you wake in the night and hear a shuffling noise in the snow, do not open your curtains. The snowman is moving about, judging if your land and home are worthy.

If you wake in the morning and the snowman has returned to its original position, congratulations! Your land and home will be safe for the next year, and you will be sure to return from any long journey you take. If you wake in the morning and the snowman is on a different part of your land, take heed of it; whatever it is near will be affected by some calamity within the following year. If you wake in the morning and the snow has not melted, but the snowman is gone, move.

The next day at sundown, take the animal material, the animal blood, and the string or rubber bands out to the snowman. Facing the snowman (you should be looking at your house over its shoulder), secure the animal materials to its right hand (your left hand) with the string or rubber bands. Dip your finger into the blood and press the finger into its right side of the face (your left side). This is the snowman’s right eye.

As you do this, recite the following:

    Snowman, Snowman

    See my herd

    Pet and cattle, fish and bird

    Snowman, Snowman

    Bless my flock

    Grow them grass from thorn and rock

Afterwards, return to your house. Lock the door, draw the curtains, and go to bed before midnight. If you wake in the night and hear a shuffling noise in your house, do not open your bedroom door. The snowman is moving about, judging if the animals in your care are worthy.

If you wake in the morning and the snowman has returned to its original position, congratulations! Your pets will be healthy for the next year, and any livestock you own will thrive. If you wake in the morning and there is an inexplicable puddle of water near something your pet owns, like your dog’s bed or your bird’s cage, take heed of it; you should probably look into pet insurance for the next year. If you wake in the morning and the snow has not melted, but the snowman is gone, say your goodbyes to them while you can. I am so, so sorry.

The next day at sundown, take the scissors and the needle out to the snowman. Facing the snowman (you should be looking at your house over its shoulder), use the needle to draw a drop of blood from your fingertip and draw it in a straight line across the snowman’s face, forming a groove in the snow. This is the snowman’s mouth. Using the scissors, clip a lock of your hair and stuff it into the groove of its mouth, ensuring that the hair does not fall out.

As you do this, recite the following:

    Snowman, Snowman

    See my breath

    Drawing ever unto death

    Snowman, Snowman

    Bless my heart

    Judge me whole and hence depart

Afterwards, return to your house. Lock the door, draw the curtains, and go to bed before midnight. If you wake in the night and feel a cold, dark presence in your bedroom, do not open your eyes. The snowman is standing over you, judging if your soul is worthy.

If you wake in the morning, congratulations! The snowman will have returned to its original position, having judged you worthy. You can expect good health and good fortune in the following year.

WARNING: To date, there are no surviving accounts of what happens to someone who is judged as unworthy. Take from that what you will.

The next day before sundown, preferably when the sun is highest, go over to the snowman. Approach it only from behind; do not walk around to face it. Demolish the snowman completely. Break the tree branches as many times as possible, and scatter the snow around the yard as evenly as you can. Make sure that no trace of it remains. Say absolutely nothing.

Once the snowman is demolished, the ritual is complete. Enjoy your year of peace and prosperity. Use it well, for when the days grow short and your luck runs thin, you may find yourself looking anxiously for the next deep snowfall. If so, I pray that the Snowman may judge you whole, this year and every year after.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if you faced the Snowman before you demolished him. Would his face look different? If you spoke to him at that point, would he answer back, or just get you in the night? Pretty creepy

Just to be safe, can I burn the branches, and then melt the snow? It would not be in my comfort range to have cursed snow and wood in my backyard.

I wonder what would happen if you don't complete the ritual? Like if you did day one and stopped or dayb two then stopped, but never knocked it down on day three.

    Coldwater Realm. Purpose: Summon creature to answer your questions. Players: 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Coldwater Realm Ritual

Do you have a question you want answered? I don’t mean any daily questions like what you will have for lunch tomorrow or if you will get sick from that bad burger you had, but a more serious one… Maybe you wish to know the future? Who you will end up with? How old you will get? Or maybe even how you will die? Perhaps what the meaning of life is? You may wish to know if there is a God, or maybe several?

If yes to any or many of these questions you want to read on and discover that there is a way to get the answers you seek. But understand that it won’t be easy and that there is no guarantee that it will work, at least not in the way you might expect it to anyway.

The ritual is called “The Coldwater Realm Ritual” and I will provide you with the information necessary to complete it. For this ritual to work, know that you must be sure of your question and that its answer really is what you seek. The powers you will be messing with while doing this is not to be taken lightly so if you don’t go all in you will get hurt! You don’t have to worry about dying, the beings in the realm you will be accessing are not interested in your death, just your mind. They might get a few scratches in though so please be sure to follow these instructions to the word if you are to attempt this.

For starters you will need a room, most use a bathroom since the second requirement is that you will need a bathtub. Prepare by covering all the windows in the chosen room thoroughly, no lights should be able to seep in. Be sure to unplug all chargers and such, everything that has a little lamp or light emitting from it should be turned off. You should cover the slits around the door as well, as a sort of safety measure. This is not actually to avoid light to get in but to keep the other realm strictly in that room and that room only. It is a common mistake to be sloppy around this and the effect that follows is that your house can become “haunted”. If the room has any mirrors or reflective surfaces you must remove or cover them too. Your place for the ritual is now ready.

When you are to perform the ritual you must be alone, not just in the room itself but in the entire house. When the clock turns 12 PM you should start filling the bathtub with hot water. And when I say hot I mean the hottest possible, it should be so hot that it hurts! Do not fill it too much though, you do not want the water to flow over when you step into it later. While the tub is being filled you are to place candles around the tub. On the floor or counters, be creative! You can use standard tealight candles but be wary that they may need to be lit a long time and you do not want them to go out. I repeat you do not want them to go out! Notice that I said place them and not light them so leave them unlit.

When you are finished, leave the room and be sure to close the door behind you. You may now live life as you please for the rest of the day, just be sure not to leave the house or have any guests over. If you do, the ritual will not work properly and you should abort the mission. By this I mean go into the room, empty the tub and remove all the unlit candles. Before you go to sleep though, be certain that you put on an alarm that will wake you up at 12 AM. Not before or after, 12 AM sharp!

If you for some kind of reason wake up at another time the ritual will not work the way you want it to. If you wake up before that, the room is not yet ready and if you were to enter the room nothing would happen, at least not that very instance. What you should do is go to the door of the room and lock it from the outside. This must be done before 12 AM! If you for some reason can’t do this you must leave the house. And don’t even try waiting for the clock to turn 12 AM, you will regret it.... If you oversleep you are kind of screwed. You do not have time to go and lock the door so just run out of the house! If you are unlucky the realm may have “leaked” out from the room and into your house, that’s why you shouldn’t be sloppy with the door covering. In that case you may as well just move… Trust me when I say, you do not wish to oversleep! In both of these cases the ritual should not be attempted ever again!

If everything goes according to plan you will wake up at 12 AM. Now, do exactly as I say! Turn off the alarm and exit the room. Do not turn on any lamps or lights as you go to the chosen room. Open the door slowly, if you feel a force pulling back on the door the ritual is working a little too well and you might have some trouble but know that you can’t abort the mission anymore! When you enter the room you will see that the candles you left there are now lit. The air inside the room will be ice cold and the candles will do nothing as to warm it.

A little side note; if the candles aren’t lit the ritual isn’t going to work and there is no harm in going back to sleep. Most probably you left some lights on inside the room. You may try the ritual again if this happens.

Do not be frightened if you see shadows of a figure inside the room, it will not touch you unless you upset it. You should now enter the tub. The water will be freezing but you must try to make as few sounds as possible as you step in. If you annoy the being from this realm you may not come out of this as sane as you might like, or as whole as you previously were.

You have now reached the part in which you are most likely to fail. You might remember when I told you that you don’t need to fear dying while doing this? This is almost true but who said death is always the worst outcome? If what you do next doesn’t satisfy the summoned being something much, much worse will happen, but I will come back to that later.

Close your eyes! Despite what might happen you must keep them closed. Take a deep breath and ask your question out loud as clearly as you can, then stay quiet. Nothing will happen this very instance but be patient, whatever you do, do not ask the being anything else or repeat yourself! This is the point where you really don’t want the candles to go out, trust me.

Suddenly you will feel a drag of wind across the room. If you were to open your eyes (do not actually do this) you would find the room in complete darkness! The being will have moved across the room to stare into your eyes and if you meet its gaze through the darkness, it will tear you completely apart. You will feel its cold breath against your face and hear its raspy breathing clearly. If you previously felt a pull on the door the being might even sit upon your legs. It will be hard to resist moving but it must be done. What the creature will do now depends on what you have asked it for and I can’t prepare you for this part. It might ask you a question back, perhaps it will grab you with its reptile like claws and search your mind, and in the worst case, hurt you, both physically and mentally. Just know that when the being is “satisfied” by your response to its doing he will back away from you.

Keep your eyes closed though, the ritual is not finished! Although the creature has moved away again, you will still feel a clear presence around you. As you lay in the water a low whisper will begin talking to you, inside your mind. It will sound comforting and safe. It will answer the question in a way you want it to, giving you all the information you have ever seeked. Suddenly a darker more menacing voice will rampage in your head, making the first voice unable to be heard! This voice will tell you the things you do not want to hear as an answer. The dark truth, of suffering and misery! Despite this, know that both voices will be speaking the truth!

Some questions have answers we humans can’t comprehend and you could become overwhelmed of all this new information the being provides you with. At this point you might wish the ritual to stop, to open your eyes and leave! Do not do this! The creature will leap forward from the shadows, showing its hideous face for a brief second before it collides with you! It will push you under the water before you can take a ghasp of air, and trap you there. It will scream inside your ears with a scream so terrifying that you will go insane. You will be torn from your soul and be left like a shell, unable to even sense the outside world. The being will then leave you and go back to its own realm. Most people who have been through this part drown, unable to find the strength to get above the water again.

Just keep your eyes closed and the voices will eventually fade out into nothingness. With this you will also feel the presence of the being around you go away. It is now safe for you to open your eyes to see that the candles around you are now lit once more.

Let your heart slow down its beating and know that you are done! You have completed the ritual! You have received the knowledge you so desperately searched for! Despite my happy tone you might not have gotten the answer you were hoping for, but do not be disappointed! Empty the tub and blow out the candles, open a window, if the room has one, and you will see that it is now day! The rays from the sun will hopefully feel a little warmer and the light a little brighter as your mind is filled with this new knowledge!

Before I leave you with these instructions I must warn you once again! You might think that this is just another made up story meant to creep you out like so many others. I can’t take that opinion away from you but please! Please do not try this if that’s how you feel! You will surely fail and I do not wish that upon you and if you will attempt this yourself I will just tell you one more thing; good luck!

Goodnight everybody!

    Black Phone Ritual Purpose: Travel to the other side and see the Distortion. Players: 1. Experiences: 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/DaiyuSamal

[RECIPE] Black Phone

This is not my own ritual. I copy pasted it from scaryforkids website just to share it with you.

The Black Phone is a scary ritual or paranormal game from Japan. In Japanese, it is called how to call the distortion room. Basically, it is a method of going to Another World, using a black telephone instead of an elevator. To play the Black Phone game, you need a pen, a piece of paper, a black, old-style dial telephone and two pieces of black string. (over 40 cm)

Before you play:

The only people in the house should be the people who are playing the game.

The house should have at least 4 rooms.

Shut all the doors and close all the curtains in the house.

Turn off every light in the house except for the lights in the room (or hallway) where the telephone is.

The ritual will not work if you have salt with you (or any other thing that inhibits the supernatural or wards off evil spirits).

Instructions:

    Tie one piece of string tightly around the telephone handset so that it cannot be removed.

2.Hold the handset away from your face and dial the following numbers: 2-0-4-0-6-0-8-0. Hang up the handset. Pick up the handset again and dial the following numbers: 2-5-5-1-5-8-2-3. Then leave the phone off the hook. Even if somebody answers, do not speak to them.

3. As quietly as possible, go into the nearest room and close the door. Wait for one minute.

4. Return to the black phone and repeat Step 2 again.

5. As quietly as possible, go into the second nearest room and close the door. Wait for one minute.

6. Return to the black phone and repeat Step 2 again.

7. As quietly as possible, go into the third nearest room and close the door. Wait for one minute.

8. Return to the black phone and dial the following numbers: 2-2-8-2-2.

9. With your eyes shut, go into the fourth nearest room and close the door

10. As soon as you enter, use the second piece of string to tie around the doorknob in a "double 8".

11. Open your eyes. Do not utter a word, no matter what.

12. Open the curtains. If the glass in the windows has turned black, then you have succeeded in travelling to another world. (The Japanese source says "you have succeeded in calling the distortion".

HOW TO END:

If you want to return to your own world:

Look for a note containing an 8-digit number that is hidden somewhere in the room.

When you find the note, keep your eyes closed, repeat the 8-digit number over and over in your head and grasp strongly the black string on the doorknob.

Do not answer if someone or something speaks to you. Do not let go of the doorknob, even if someone or something pulls your body.

Keep repeating the 8-digit number over and over in your head, no matter how many times it takes, until it seems like you are back in your own world. Then, open the door.

If the windows of the other rooms are still black, then it means you still have not returned to your own world.

You must burn the note containing the number to ashes within 7 days. Put the ashes in a black bag or wrap them in paper and carry them with you.

After that, it says, "you will encounter a strange phenomenon" and when you encounter this phenomenon, it says, "your happiness will be reduced".

Very creepy! I'd like to try this one but I have a question. After I dial the first two numbers, it says to leave the phone off the hook. Then I go into the closest room, close the door for one minute and return to the phone. Do I hang up the phone before I repeat step 2? Or just dial the both numbers off the hook?

I know you said you didn't write the recipe but I wasn't sure if you had any extra information. Thanks!

    Dark Music. Purpose: Get a spirit to play you a song. Player: 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]3 years ago
Dark Music Ritual [Recipe]

The Dark Music Ritual is from Hide and Go Kill. This is not my original work. EDIT: Formatting

Ingredients

    An instrument (like a Guitar or Flute)

    A pointy pin or razor blade

    A Cup of Salt Water

    Salt Shaker

    Pencil (NOT Pen)

    Paper

    Somewhere Dark to Hide

    A Camera (Optional)

    Music Notes (Optional)

Instructions

    Take the instrument of your choice and place it by the house's front door. Make sure it is not covered in any way, or the ghost will become confused, and angry.

    Using a pin or blade, draw a bit of blood from the area normally used to play the instrument. (For a guitar, prick your finger, for a flute, slice your lip). Take this blood and wipe it on the area that is used to play the music. On the guitar, you'd wipe the blood on the string, and on the flute, the mouthpiece.

    Using your pencil, write a small letter on a sheet of blank paper. Be sure the message is respectful and kind, or else you are going to anger the spirit. An example is what I have used each time, but you may change it:

"Spirit, from the world unknown,

Play for me please, a song you know.

Spirit, I offer you my instruments,

to play for me, a song you know."

    With the note set up, it is time to begin the performance. Leave the note beside your instrument and make sure all lights in the area are turned off. More importantly however, make sure there is no sound. Any type of noise during the performance, even breathing too loudly, will cause the ghost to stop. You do not want your breathing to stop the music, or else the ghost will get extremely angry. If this happens, you must immediately end the session in the Forgiving Way. (Explained later.)

    Begin to walk away and find a place to listen, where you cannot see the instrument. As you leave, draw a line of salt that complete blocks you off from the instrument. This is a safeguard that I've found to be very helpful.

    Sit in the darkness and wait. Unlike most game, this game does not have a specific time, but between the hours of 11PM and 4AM seem to work the best. Be sure to have the cup of salt water in your hands at all times, as you need this to end the performance.

Safeguards

First, and generally what will keep you safe, is your respect to the ghost. Being kind, grateful, and appreciative will keep you free from harm. Remember, this game is not to be taken lightly, despite the point of it not being to strictly invoke or interact with the ghost. If at any point you are rude, you must end the game the Forgiving Way. Secondly is the line of salt. If you go to end the performance and this line is broken, something has angered the spirit, and you must end the game the Forgiving Way IMMEDIATELY.

There are also optional things to do with the notes and camera, but I would suggest against this your first time. You can place the paper with musical notes next to your written note, giving the spirit something to play. When you do this, the notes act as part of your written words. You must do with them what you do with the written words while you end the performance. Secondly, something I have never tried, is to record the instrument from far away. I dare not anger the spirit that much. If you attempt this, I wish you luck, as I cannot tell you how to stop what may happen to you.

Ending The Performance

There are two main ways to end the game. The first way, and the way you want to happen, is the Thankful Way. When you end the game like this, everything has gone properly, and you show your gratitude to the spirit for their performance. The second way, and the way you do not want to have to end the game, is the Forgiving Way. This way must be done if you have angered the ghost, or anything of the likes.

Way 1: Thankful Way

If all has gone as it should, and the music stopped peacefully, or you simply want the ghost to stop playing, you can end the performance the Thankful Way. Walk out to the the salt line, and break the line in the middle with both hands. If the salt line was already broken, quickly revert to the Forgiving Way. This breaking of the line shows the ghost great respect when you do it. By now, the music should stop. If it does not, do not panic, but be ready to be disturbed a bit by what you may see once you proceed.

    Now that the line is broken, walk to the instrument, being careful not to stand between the instrument and door. Be sure to smile while facing the spirit to show you appreciated the performance.

    Take the piece of paper and fold it nicely three times. Once folded, drop it into the cup of salt water. Set this down where the note was before.

    Close your eyes and bow to the spirit, chanting the following words three times to show how much you enjoyed the performance:

"Thank you spirit, you can stop your play,

I have enjoyed it, but it is nearly day."

    Having respected the spirit and warned it of the soon coming sunlight, it will now leave. Most importantly now, make sure you use the same salt water you brought in the cup to wash away the blood on the instrument, or this will invite the spirit back to play night after night. Doing this, and forgetting to show respect, even for a night, has terrible consequences.

    You are now free to do whatever you please for the rest of the night, but it is recommended you do something quietly and to yourself, or simply go to sleep.

Way 2: Forgiving Way

    Quickly run next to the instrument with your cup of salt water. DO NOT STAND BETWEEN THE INSTRUMENT AND THE DOOR. Splash the cup of salt water between the instrument and the door. This will temporarily disable the spirit. From this point on, you have made the ghost enraged. You have around 15 seconds to finish the Forgiving Way now.

    Take the note you have made and tear it into 5 pieces, crumpling each piece and throwing it into the salt water, so each piece is wetted. This can be more difficult if you have used the optional music notes as well.

    Chant for Forgiveness three times by saying the following with your eyes closed, while bowing and facing the spirit.

"Forgive me, spirit, I stopped your play.

Forgive me please, I wish to stay."

NOTEThe forgiving way must be done in the following circumstances:

    You hear the music stop suddenly.

    You begin to hear sour notes during the performance.

    Any other loud noise is heard throughout the house.

    You leave to end the game, and find the salt line broken.

    You leave to end the game, and find your instrument broken.

    While performing the Thankful Way, you spilled some of the salt water.

    If these events occur, you must follow these steps exactly to end the game.

Ending

    This is the point where 15 seconds cannot have passed. If it has, I'm sorry. If not, take the instrument and begin playing. What you play cannot be complicated or impressive, as you must show the ghost its performance was excellent. Make continuous noise for 10 more seconds. This will show the spirit it is better than you, and it will leave for now. After the 10 seconds, turn on lights and stay further in silence for an hour. DO NOT PLAY MUSIC. The ghost will be waiting. The ghost will be listening.

    After the hour, wash away the blood from the instrument using a new batch of salt water. This eliminates the chance of the spirit coming back.

Warning

    Do not, under any circumstance, try to out perform the spirit.

    Do not disrupt the spirit's performance on purpose. It will know, and it will not forgive you.

    Do not try to recreate what the ghost was playing.

I cannot tell you what will happen to you if you attempt these things. I have never read about what happens after these events, and I'm sure I haven't for very good reasons. This "game" is not about playing with the spirit, it is about appreciating it.

15. Return to the one-two pounding motion on the principal’s back. Repeat the Chorus.

16. Cease the pounding motion. Proceed to the fifth Verse of the Words. The fifth Verse is as follows (NOTE: This Verse’s rhythm may be slightly different than that of Verses one through four; adapt as necessary): Wrap a rope around your neck, wrap it ‘til it’s tight Wrap a rope around your neck, and PULL

17. While you speak or sing the Verse, perform the following motions simulating the experience described by the Words (repeat each motion whenever they occur in the Verse): On the word “rope,” mime wrapping a rope around the principal’s neck. Do NOT place your hands around the principal’s neck; simply draw a line lightly around their neck with your hand to simulate the “rope” and release them. On the word “pull,” place your hands on the principal’s shoulders and push lightly but sharply downwards.

18. Hold the principal by the arms. Lean in close. Whisper the following Words in their ear: You’re standing on a building You’re out on the ledge You’re feeling very dizzy You’re close to the edge And someone PUSHES YOU

19. On the word “pushes,” push the principal lightly but sharply forwards — just hard enough to make them lose their balance, but not hard enough to throw them to the ground.

20. To close the game: If you are the guide: Instruct the principal to open their eyes and immediately describe to you what color they see. If you are the principal: Open your eyes when instructed by the guide and immediately describe to them what color you see.

Concerning the Colors: If the principal sees the color red: They will die by stabbing. If the principal sees the color blue: They will die by drowning. If the principal sees the color yellow: They will die by poison. If the principal sees the color orange: They will die by fire. If the principal sees the color green: They will die by falling. If the principal sees the color purple: They will die by asphyxiation. If the principal sees the color grey: They will die by illness. If the principal sees the color white: They will die of old age and ascend to heaven. If the principal sees the color black: They will die of old age and descend to hell. If the principal sees the color brown: They will be buried alive.

I remember playing this game on the playground during elementary school, it was just a goofy thing and we'd make up the answers based on colors, for example I remember being told I'd die in a field of violet flowers because I saw purple once...it's funny to see these games all come back!

holllly crap. I don't wanna know. no siree. I want it to be a surprise. I'm only 8th grade, I don't need to worry about how I'mma die for the rest of my life.

Problem is, I do wanna do this. Maybe I'll just cut out the dying part and get strangled. It'll be fun. But not fortune-telling.

We used to play this at slumber parties, but I don't remember the "how you're going to die" colors thing. It was just a thrill being pushed after you'd been lulled into a sort of peace by all the pounding on the back and running up and down of fingers.

    Picture Game Purpose: Catch spirits on camera. Players: 2+. Experience: Available on YouTube.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Picture Game [Recipe]

The Picture Game is from Ghost in my Machine. This is not my original work. EDIT: Formatting

Players

    At least two participants. The more, the better. There is no principal.

Requirements

    A length of string, rope, or other similar material. This length of string, rope, or other material should be long enough to make a circle when the ends are knotted together.

    Scissors, a knife, or another sharp edge.

    One small mirror per participant.

    A camera with flash capabilities. Camera phones are NOT recommended.

    A drinking glass.

    A beverage, preferably alcoholic. Wine is recommended.

    A quiet room.

Instructions

    Begin at midnight.

    Make the string or rope into a circle by tying the ends together in a knot.

    Place the rope circle in the middle of the room.

    Place the drinking glass in the middle of the rope circle.

    Fill the glass with the beverage.

    Arrange the participants in a circle by seating them around the outside of the rope circle.

NOTE: Do NOT step into the center of the rope circle at any time or for any reason.

    Each participant must place their mirror in front of them. The reflective part of the mirror should be pointed at the ceiling.

    Turn off the lights.

The Invitation

    The participants must close their eyes. The circle of participants must hold hands.

    Each participant must say, one after another, the phrase, “I trust you.” The participants should not speak this phrase in unison; each participant must say it individually.

    After each participant has stated their trust, all participants should repeat three times, in unison, the words, “The door is open, please come in.”

    The participants may then open their eyes.

The Sitting

    Begin the sitting by having one participant take up the camera. This participant must say the words, “I caught you”; then, pointing the camera forward (toward the middle of the circle), the participant must take one picture.

    Pass the camera to the next participant in the circle. If using a digital camera, do not preview the image that was just taken. The next participant must also say the words, “I caught you,” and take one picture with the camera facing forward.

    Repeat this process until every participant has taken three pictures. The camera should make its way around the circle three times.

NOTE: If a participant begins crying or feels nauseous, do NOT allow them to take any pictures. Instead, pass the camera around them to the next participant in the circle.

    After the camera has passed around the circle three times, put it down.

The Farewell

    All participants must close their eyes and repeat three times, in unison, the phrase, “It is time to go home.”

    Each participant must turn their mirror upside down.

    Turn on the lights.

    Using the scissors, knife, or other sharp edge, cut open the rope circle.

    Take the drinking glass outside and empty it. It is recommended that you empty it onto a patch of dirt or earth.

The Review

You may now review the photos taken during the ritual. What do you see?

Look closely.

Closer.

There.

Additional Notes

Although there is no principal, it may help for organizational purposes to designate one participant as the Point Person. This Point Person may create the rope circle, place and fill the glass, operate the lights, begin the “I trust you” section, be the first participant to take up the camera, cut the rope circle, and empty the glass at the conclusion of the ritual.

Red Flags

If any of the following occur, DO NOT PROCEED:

    One or more participants begin acting in an uncharacteristic manner.

    One or more participants state that they are frightened.

NOTE If the ritual must be aborted, you may do so by putting the camera down and proceeding directly to The Farewell, Step 1.

If A Red Flag Participant Takes A Picture:

    Do not look at the picture.

    Do not continue with the ritual.

    Destroy the camera.

    A Small Radio Purpose: Receive good luck for a year! Players: 1. (Note: Must be performed on October 30th at 11:59 PM)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]3 years ago
A Small Radio [Recipe]

The Small Radio is a recipe from The Ghost in my Machine. This is not my original work. Enjoy! EDIT: Formatting

Players

-One principal.

Ingredients

-One mobile phone

-An outdoor location

Instructions

    Wait until Oct. 30

    Begin at 11:59pm

    Go outside

    Using your hands, draw a circle into the dirt.

    Set you phone to vibrate. Place it in the middle of the circle.

    Keep your eyes on the phone. Do not close your eyes. Do not look away from it.

    Continue watching the phone until 12:15am.

    If nothing happens: The ritual has failed. Do not proceed.

    If the phone rings: You may proceed. However, do NOT answer the phone. Simply wait.

    Continue waiting

    If nothing happens: The ritual has failed. Do not proceed.

    If you receive a text message: You may proceed. Read the text; it will contain a phone number.

    Set your phone to speaker and call the number

    If no one picks up: The ritual has failed. Do not proceed.

    If the call is answered: You may proceed. Listen. If you are asked for your physical address, give it to whoever asks. (NOTE FROM POCKETPANCHO, PLEASE BE CAREFUL GIVING RANDOM PEOPLE YOUR ADDRESS!)

    Wait for two nights. Go about your life in the meantime. Try not to get distracted.

The Gift

    At the end of the waiting period, make sure you’re well-rested enough to stay awake until midnight.

    When the clock ticks over to 11:59pm, listen.

    If you hear nothing: The ritual has failed. Do not proceed.

    If you hear a knock on the door: Answer it. You won’t find anyone there, so don’t bother looking for them; however, there will be a package waiting or you on the doorstep. Bring it inside.

    Open the package. Take out the contents: Batteries, and a small radio. Put the batteries in the radio.

    Wait until 12:15am, then turn the radio on and tune it to AM station 11.1.

    Listen

    Keep listening

    Do not stop listening

    At 12:25am, a song will play. Listen to it deeply and fully.

    For the next year, keep the radio on. You might not always hear it, but that doesn’t matter. As long as it’s on and playing, you will experience an astonishing amount of good luck. You will succeed in everything and anything you do, no matter how big or small.

The Price

One day, you will hear a startling noise — something you might describe as a pop, or maybe a gunshot. It’s the sound of the batteries in the radio dying. When you hear that noise, start running.

Concerning the Price

Once you start running, don’t stop. There’s no guarantee that it will do anything other than delay the inevitable, but it might make you feel better in the long run. Like you’re doing something that might help — even though it won’t.

After all, you can’t have the good without the bad…

…And everything catches up to us eventually.

    Bed of Sorrow Purpose: Reduce or eliminate your sorrow for 7 days.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]3 years ago
Bed of Sorrow [Recipe]

The Bed of Sorrow ritual is originally from CreepyPasta. This is not my original work. Enjoy!

The Bed of Sorrow is a legend born from many ancient ghost stories and folktales that have, over time, become merged into the story we know today. It is practiced in small numbers by those who either believe in its supposed power or who simply seek a thrill in the manner of other haunted games such as Bloody Mary.

The legend states that the Bed of Sorrow was used by a poor soul long since departed who would weep day and night into the sheets, unable to be consoled as they withered away in that bed—never leaving, not even to eat, drink, or relieve themselves.

In time the inevitable occurred and the tragic figure died, still weeping—although they were removed from the bed and given a burial, the bed itself would begin to exhibit unnatural properties such as the once white sheets turning a shade of red.

A feeling of continual dread surrounded the bed and thus, if the story is to be believed, it was destroyed in an effort to end what many believed was a curse left behind by a restless spirit.

As with such stories however, the bed is said to somehow materialize even to this day, and those who seek it out are said to find any abandoned house and search for a single room with a red door that appears locked.

Knocking on the door twice opens it and the explorer may enter, upon doing so they will notice the room is completely empty with no furniture or windows—the only object to be found is a single bed in the middle of the room with red sheets.

This is when the explorer has a choice to leave the room and never return, as many do, yet if one dares to proceed they may close the red door behind them and make their way to the bed and lay down on it, making sure to lay on top of the sheets.

As they lay on the bed, they must close their eyes and remain deadly still, the sound of weeping will fill the room and the sound of knocking will come from the red door. One must keep still and never open their eyes, no matter how loud the weeping gets or how violent the knocking becomes.

The bed will seem to shake, but once again, one must not open their eyes nor move, eventually the shaking will stop and the room will go silent—at this point a voice will whisper from the dark:

"It is done."

At that moment one must open one's eyes and leave the room—being sure to close the door behind them and not look back, one must continue to exit the house and head back home without looking back or talking to anyone or anything on the journey back.

Should a figure in red appear at any point during one's journey home, run and do not stop. Should a figure in white appear, however, keep walking and under no circumstances begin to run.

Should one make it home, immediately go to bed and sleep—when one awakens all feelings of doubt and grief will vanish, the story claims the Bed of Sorrow shall take away one's troubles for up to seven days following the encounter but should any of the steps be missed or broken, the weight of one's grief and doubt will increase tenfold every day until one can successfully complete the tasks.

    The Apex Purpose: Prove your surviving skills in the wild! Players: 2+.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Posted byu/[deleted]3 years ago
The Apex [Recipe]

The Apex recipe is from CreepyPasta. This ritual is not my original work. So...here you go!

EDIT: Formatting and some grammar from the original post. No vital ritual information has been altered.

For this ritual to work and gain your prize you will need the following items:

Ingredients

    A small bag

    A close group of friends or a friend you can trust

Instructions

    Go to a forest as far away from civilization as possible.

    Invite a friend or several to come with you into the forest. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Under no circumstances are you to leave your friend behind, kill them, or beg for mercy.

    After memorizing these warnings, place your hands in a circle and shout in the forest, “We are allies! We wish to game a worthy opponent! Will no challenger face us?”

    When you all hear the sound of a branch coming down with a mighty crash, run.

    Again, make sure to NOT get separated from your group. This is how it hunts. It separates the group to pick off one by one. If you do happen to trail off from each other quickly get back together.

    For one whole day and night you and your partner or group of close friends must avoid “The Apex”. You and your group are “The Herd”. Beware, it is seasoned and will stop at nothing to get you.

    Never look at its face. It is said turning around while being chased and looking at it may cause memory loss and/or paralysis.

    Do not attempt to leave the woods before the time is up. It will hunt you and those around you until you die.

Finishing the game

Once it stops and the game is over, collect your prize. When getting out of the forest you will be greeted by a female park ranger. She will ask you in a cheerful tone “Are you worthy?” Always answer “Am I?” and nothing else.

Answer yes and your friends will be shot with an arrow where they stand, leaving you in the bloody wake of your now dead companions. Answer no and you will be shot instead.

After answering correctly, the ranger will hand you a large box. Take it quickly before she disappears.

Do not look into the box until you are in a more familiar area. Inside you and your friends will find either a special item they lost or a sheet of paper explaining a grim personal secret so disturbing it fills anyone who reads it with dread and rage beyond comprehension.

Happy hunting.

So there are no benefits from doing it? I find a funny reoccurence with all of these, you're never allowed to look back at the entity. So basically you're not allowed proof, so for all you know you and your friends are running from nothing.

If you are 'successful,' you receive a box with either an item you've lost or a piece of paper with a personal secret (though I'm not sure how that is a benefit.)

Agreed, not looking directly at the entity is a common theme with rituals and games. IMO the unknown is usually more terrifying than actually seeing the monster for yourself. The more scared the players are the greater chance their imaginations will start to run wild. When you're scared, every tree branch cracking turns into the monster right behind you.

Exactly.. And saying your mind can't comprehend it so you'll go insane is just a cheap cop out when in reality you're probably all running from nothing.

Put it this way, if I were to do this ritual with my friends and we heard a branch snap, okay that's bit scary we start running. If, after a while I couldn't hear anything, I would just go back to my tent and smash some beers and forget about it. And if it actually worked then I'd find out when it comes to out campsite. But I ain't running around for 24 hours in a forest from a branch.

Not gonna lie, drinking beer and eating s'mores around a campfire sounds much more appealing than running around in a forest all night. Haha!

Though I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get a wink of sleep. My imagination would spin out of control. Even if it's just a 0.5% chance that I summoned some freaky monster...nuh uh, no sleep for me thank you very much.
